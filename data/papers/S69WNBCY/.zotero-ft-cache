Humans have evolved an extraordinarily expanded and complex cerebral cortex associated with developmental and gene regulatory modifications1–3. Human accelerated regions (HARs) are highly conserved DNA sequences with human-specific nucleotide substitutions. Although there are thousands of annotated HARs, their functional contribution to species-specific cortical development remains largely unknown4,5. HARE5 is a HAR transcriptional enhancer of the WNT signalling receptor Frizzled8 that is active during brain development6. Here, using genome-edited mouse (Mus musculus, Mm) and primate models, we demonstrated that human (Homo sapiens, Hs) HARE5 fine-tunes cortical development and connectivity by controlling the proliferative and neurogenic capacities of neural progenitor cells. Hs-HARE5 knock-in mice have significantly enlarged neocortices, containing more excitatory neurons. By measuring neural dynamics in vivo, we showed that these anatomical features result in increased functional independence between cortical regions. We assessed underlying developmental mechanisms using fixed and live imaging, lineage analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing. We discovered that Hs-HARE5 modifies radial glial cell behaviour, with increased self-renewal at early developmental stages, followed by expanded neurogenic potential. Using genomeedited human and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, Pt) neural progenitor cells and cortical organoids, we showed that four human-specific variants of Hs-HARE5 drive increased enhancer activity that promotes progenitor proliferation. Finally, we showed that Hs-HARE5 increased progenitor proliferation by amplifying canonical WNT signalling. These findings illustrate how small changes in regulatory DNA can directly affect critical signalling pathways to modulate brain development. Our study uncovered new functions of HARs as key regulatory elements crucial for the expansion and complexity of the human cerebral cortex.
Humans are distinguishable from other species by their enlarged cerebral cortex and extraordinary cognitive capacities. Underlying these features is the expansion of neural cell number, diversity and circuitry1,2. Relative to other species, humans have protracted corticogenesis, allowing for increased neuron production and maturation, including abundant upper layers. During cortical neurogenesis, the primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the ventricular zone are radial glial cells (RGCs). These progenitors are derived from neuroepithelial cells and initially undergo self-renewing divisions to expand the precursor pool. As development proceeds, RGCs shift to differentiating divisions to produce both neurons and basal progenitors. In mice, the predominant basal progenitors are intermediate progenitors (IPs), which primarily undergo symmetric neurogenic divisions. In humans
and non-human primates, RGCs and basal progenitors have increased abundance, composition and proliferative capacity, which together amplify neuronal production7,8. Thus, the number of neurons is collectively defined by the balanced proliferative and neurogenic divisions of the neural precursors. However, we have a limited molecular understanding of how progenitors are controlled to generate unique primate features. Comparative genomics of primates has revealed extensive humanspecific loci, including chromosomal duplications, deletions and point mutations1,2. Although protein-coding regions are highly conserved between humans and their closest extant relative (the chimpanzee), differences in non-coding DNA are especially prominent and posited to help explain human-specific features9.

regions (HARs) are enriched in non-coding DNA in humans10–14. Nearly 3,000 HARs have been identified, many of which are located near neurodevelopmental genes and act as gene regulatory enhancers in neural cells5,10–17. The use of transgenic mice, zebrafish and massively parallel reporter assays in vitro have shown that HARs have tissue and species-specific enhancer activity regardless of the trans environment5,15,18. Furthermore, mutations in HARs are associated with neurological diseases19–21. However, with exceptions in the skin and developing limb22,23 and deletions of ancestral sequences24, the direct function of HARs in vivo is unknown. Indeed, a key gap is how thousands of HARs functionally contribute to the features of the human brain (Fig. 1a). We previously discovered HARE5 (ANC516)10, which diverges between humans and chimpanzees and exhibits a species-specific enhancer activity in the developing mouse forebrain6. HARE5 is located on chromosome (chr.) 10, with four human-specific nucleotides across 619 bp. Endogenous mouse HARE5 acts as an enhancer of Fzd8, a receptor in the WNT signalling pathway, which is crucial for cortical progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and disease25–29. Transgenic mice in which human HARE5 (Hs-HARE5) directly drives Mm-Fzd8 expression (Hs-HARE5::Fzd8) have enlarged cortices6. These findings implicate the role of Hs-HARE5 in brain development. However, how it mechanistically controls human-specific features remains unknown. Investigating HARE5 provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand how HARs drive various brain features (Fig. 1a). Here we used orthogonal models across genomically edited mouse, human and chimpanzee cells to discover new molecular mechanisms underlying human-specific cortical development (Fig. 1b). Hs-HARE5 modifies neuronal number, cortical size and functional connectivity by expanding the proliferative and neurogenic capacities of cortical progenitors. Furthermore, human-specific mutations in Hs-HARE5 increase progenitor proliferation by amplifying canonical WNT signalling. These data demonstrate how the gene regulatory modifications of a key developmental signalling pathway contribute to human-specific brain features.
HARE5 activates species-divergent FZD8 expression
First, we characterized HARE5 activity and target gene expression in the developing human brain. Interrogation of DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq) and H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) datasets30,31 revealed that HARE5 is an active enhancer in the developing human cerebral cortex (Fig. 1c). Through Hi-C, Hs-HARE5 was found to interact with three genes, with FZD8 being the most frequently targeted gene32 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To demonstrate that HARE5 is an enhancer of FZD8 in human neural cells, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to target HARE5 (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Compared with the mock control, H3K27me3 levels were significantly elevated at HARE5, indicating repression of the enhancer (Extended Data Fig. 1c). By contrast, the promoters of FZD8 and nearby Hi-C targets (GJD4 and CCNY) were not enriched for this repressive epigenetic mark. As further evidence of specificity, following CRISPRi treatment, the expression of FZD8, but not GJD4 and CCNY, was significantly reduced (Extended Data Fig. 1d). This indicates that HARE5 is an active enhancer in the developing human cortex and specifically controls the expression of FZD8 in human neural cells. Given that human and chimpanzee HARE5 orthologues exhibit differential enhancer activity in mouse embryos6, we predict that FZD8 may diverge between related species. Rich transcriptomic datasets are available for Rhesus macaque, a phylogenetically related and commonly studied non-human primate33,34. Thus, we probed bulk RNA sequencing datasets of developing human and macaque neocortices from BrainSpan and PsychENCODE33. Compared with the prenatal macaque neocortex, the prenatal human neocortex showed significantly higher
FZD8 expression. By contrast, in the cerebellum and postnatal cortex, FZD8 expression levels were comparable between species (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Further integrated bulk expression data of the developing mouse neocortex35,36 revealed that Fzd8 expression was highest during early prenatal mouse neocortical development, similar to that in humans (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). These data indicate that, compared to related primates, the human fetal neocortex has significantly higher FZD8 expression. We assessed the extent to which HARE5 activity and FZD8 expression were cell-type specific in the developing cortex. Notably, HARE5 showed DNase I hypersensitivity and H3K27ac epigenetic marks in NPCs but not in neurons, reflecting cell-specific enhancer activity30,31 (Fig. 1c). Inspection of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets showed that FZD8 is mainly expressed in cortical RGCs but not in newborn excitatory neurons of the developing mouse, macaque and human cortices34,37,38 (Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Thus, although FZD8 levels diverge across species, the overarching pattern of expression is conserved. This is consistent with the similar enhancer activity distribution patterns of Hs-HARE5 and Pt-HARE5 in the mouse forebrain6. In summary, these data demonstrate that HARE5 enhancer activity and the expression of its target gene (FZD8) are enriched in NPCs, particularly RGCs, of the developing cerebral cortex.
Hs-HARE5 increases cortical size and neuron number
We tested the hypothesis that Hs-HARE5 promotes human features in the mouse cortex. To this end, we generated a knock-in mouse, in which both mouse HARE5 (Mm-HARE5Mm/Mm)alleles were replaced with the corresponding human HARE5 (Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs) (Fig. 1e). To assess the impact of manipulating the chromatin andthe ancestral function of Mm-HARE5 during mouse cortical development, we surrounded this locus with two loxP sites to generate a conditional knockout (cKO) (Mm-HARE5cKO). To generate Mm-HARE5cKO mice, we used Emx1-Cre, which is active in cortical progenitors and their progeny beginning on embryonic day (E)9.5 (ref. 39). For all analyses, we compared both knock-in and cKO mice with wild-type control littermates (Mm-HARE5Mm/Mm) (Fig. 1e). In E14.5 cortices, Fzd8 messenger RNA (mRNA) exhibited a significant 25% increase in Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs and a 50% decrease in Mm-HARE5cKO compared with the control (Fig. 1f). However, neither Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs nor Mm-HARE5cKO significantly affected the levels of the Hi-C target (Ccny) in the developing mouse brain (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Hs-HARE5 is an enhancer of Fzd8, with stronger activity than Mm-HARE5 in the developing mouse cortex. We quantified the effect of Hs-HARE5 on brain size. The cortices of 3-month-old postnatal brains were significantly increased in Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs compared with control (Fig. 1g,h). This increase was also observed when normalizing cortical area to body weight (Extended Data Fig. 3b). At P0, we observed similar, although not quite significant, trends in both heterozygote and homozygote cortices (Extended Data Fig. 3c–e). By contrast, loss of either one or both copies of Mm-HARE5 (cHet and cKO, respectively) from neural progenitors and their progeny led to a mild but significant reduction in cortical area compared with the control (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). These data demonstrate that the introduction of human HARE5 increases cortical size in mice, whereas the loss of mouse HARE5 reduces cortical size. This reinforces the importance of the HARE5 enhancer for cortical size. We quantified neurons in the Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs brains. At postnatal day (P)21, we measured significantly more mature NeuN+ excitatory neurons in the Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs mouse cortex than in the control (Fig. 1i,j). Quantification of laminar markers BRN2 (II/III), ROR-β (IV), CTIP2 (V) and TBR1 (VI) revealed that Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices had a significantly higher ratio of upper layers (II/III, IV) to deep layers (V, VI) (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 3f,g–j). These data demonstrate that Hs-HARE5 promotes increased excitatory neuron number, with a biased increase in upper-layer neurons in the mouse neocortex.

Hs-HARE5 affects functional connectivity in the cortex We investigated whether increased enhancer activity, cortical size and neuron number affect functional activity across the cortex. An expanded cortical neuron number can increase the neuron ensemble number and functional segregation of local neural networks within the visual cortex40. Thus, we predicted that cortical expansion and increased neuron number in Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs mice may similarly alter baseline functional network dynamics. To test this, we mapped the resting-state dynamics across the dorsal cortex using wide-field calcium imaging in awake mice, as previously described41,42 (Fig. 1l). We performed spatio-temporal clustering to parcellate the cortex into functional clusters and measure inter-region independence. Compared with the control, homozygous and heterozygous mice exhibited significantly more functionally independent activity between the cortical regions in primary sensory (whisker barrel field, S1bf), premotor (rostral and caudal M2) and higher-order associative regions (retrosplenial (RSP)) (Fig. 1m–p and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Hs-HARE5 mice similarly exhibited lower intraregion correlation within clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4b–e). These data show that Hs-HARE5 alters the functional properties of cortical networks by increasing functional independence between the cortical regions. This increase in functional independence raised the question of whether Hs-HARE5 alters neural connectivity. We observed no significant difference in synapsin1+ global synapse number between the control and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs in either the upper or deep layers of the adult somatosensory cortex (S1bf) (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Similarly, using OLIG2 and SOX9, we detected no significant difference in the number of oligodendrocytes or astrocytes between the control and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices (Extended Data Fig. 5d–g). Although these results indicate that Hs-HARE5 does not affect the global synapse and glia number at P21, they do not preclude the possibility that synaptic connectivity per neuron is decreased or that there are changes in specific circuit motifs.
Hs-HARE5 amplifies RGCs during early corticogenesis We investigated the developmental basis of the Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs postnatal brain phenotypes. We first analysed the cells that displayed Hs-HARE5 activity in the developing mouse cortex. For this, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse (Hs-HARE5::EGFP-PEST6), in which EGFP was a reporter of enhancer activity (Fig. 2a). Hs-HARE5 enhancer activity was highest within the germinal regions of the developing neocortex at E11.5, E14.5 and E16.5 (Fig. 2a). Within the germinal zone, at E14.5, approximately 90% of Hs-HARE5 activated cells were RGCs, with lower activity levels in IPs (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 6a). These results indicate that Hs-HARE5 drives robust expression in the radial glia of the developing telencephalon. This observation is consistent with the active epigenetic marks of HARE5, specifically in human NPCs (Fig. 1c) and the RGC-enriched expression of Fzd8 in mice and primate brains (Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). On the basis of this enhancer activity pattern, we predicted that Hs-HARE5 affects neurons by acting in RGCs. To investigate this possibility, we first assessed early-stage RGCs at the onset of neurogenesis at E12.5. Although the overall number of SOX2+ RGCs was unaffected in the Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortex, the fraction of mitotic RGCs increased (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs progenitors exhibited reduced cell cycle exit from E11.5 to E12.5, indicating increased self-renewal (Fig. 2f–h). These findings demonstrate that Hs-HARE5 promotes the proliferative capacity and self-renewal of early-stage E12.5 RGCs. We also measured the requirement of the ancestral Mm-HARE5 for RGC proliferation. Although the Mm-HARE5cKO RGC number and mitotic index were unaffected, RGC cell cycle exit increased from E11.5 to E12.5 (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). This indicates that the loss of Mm-HARE5
decreases RGC self-renewal, whereas Hs-HARE5 increases it. These findings indicate that Hs-HARE5 is necessary and sufficient for early-stage RGC expansion at the onset of neurogenesis.
Hs-HARE5 influences neural progenitor composition
We assessed the effect of Hs-HARE5 at E14.5, a peak stage of neurogenesis when RGCs actively produce neurons and IPs (Fig. 2i). The density of SOX2+ RGCs significantly increased by 11% in the E14.5 Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices compared with the control (Fig. 2j). Notably, in Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs brains, IPs increased by 28%, with a significant 33% expansion in TBR2+SOX2+ newborn IPs (Fig. 2k,l). Consistent with this, Mm-HARE5Hs/Mm cortices contained more basally dividing and mitotic TBR2+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 6g–j). Similar trends were observed in both heterozygotes and homozygotes (Extended Data Fig. 6k–m). This demonstrates that, at the mid-stages of neurogenesis, Hs-HARE5 increases both RGCs and IPs, with a particularly profound effect on newborn IPs. To further probe how Hs-HARE5 influences cellular composition, we used scRNA-seq of E14.5 Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs and control cortices (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Louvain clustering revealed 28 clusters in both genotypes, which were assigned as RGCs, IPs, neurons and non-neural cells (Fig. 2m and Supplementary Table 1). In control cortices, Fzd8 expression was primarily limited to RGCs, consistent with the scRNA-seq datasets of mice and primates37,38 (Fig. 2n). This cell-specific pattern was observed in HARE5Hs/Hs brains, with significant increases in Fzd8 levels in RGCs (Fig. 2o). Thus, although Hs-HARE5 increased Fzd8 levels in RGCs, itdid not modify the overall spatial expression pattern. We then assessed RGC and IP composition and transcript expression by re-clustering these populations independently. There were subtle differences in the composition of both RGCs and IPs between the control and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs groups, which could reflect altered cell states (Extended Data Fig. 7b–e and Supplementary Table 1). Differentially expressed genes were identified in both progenitors, with RGCs showing alterations associated with DNA binding (Extended Data Fig. 7f and Supplementary Table 1). These scRNA-seq data provide orthogonal evidence that Hs-HARE5 promotes Fzd8 expression in RGCs with subtle alterations in progenitor subtypes.
Hs-HARE5 affects progenitor lineage and progeny fate Our data indicate that Hs-HARE5 promotes the self-renewing expansion of E12.5 RGCs and more abundant RGCs and newborn IPs at E14.5. We postulated that these E14.5 progenitors ultimately produce more neurons. To test this, we measured the cell cycle exit of the control and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs progenitors using 24-h BrdU pulse-chase assays at two different stages (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). From E13.5 to E14.5, the progenitors showed a trend but an insignificant increase in cell cycle exit between genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). A day later, from E14.5 to E15.5, the Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs progenitors exhibited significantly more cell cycle exit than the control (Fig. 3a–c). We then quantified the fraction of BrdU+ cells that expressed TBR2 but were KI67−, indicating that this population reflects TBR2+ newborn neurons derived from TBR2+ IPs (Extended Data Fig. 8d–f). There was no significant difference in the cell cycle exit of TBR2+ IPs. We also measured the fraction of BrdU+ cells that expressed SOX2 but were KI67− (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Differentiating IPs typically do not retain SOX2 expression43,44; thus, we reasoned that this population should primarily report SOX2+ newborn neurons generated from SOX2+ RGCs (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Compared with the control, E15.5 Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs brains contained a significantly higher proportion of SOX2+ cells exiting the cell cycle (29% versus 38%, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Both sets of analyses underestimate exiting progenitors owing to the labels used and timing of BrdU. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Hs-HARE5 promotes increased differentiation at E15.5.

To measure how Hs-HARE5 affects progenitor progeny in vivo, we used in utero electroporation (IUE) to perform short-term lineage tracing of dividing progenitors from E14.5 to E15.5 (Fig. 3d). IUE targets apical cells lining the ventricle, which are primarily RGCs45. By contrast to the control, Hs-HARE5 significantly increased EGFP+ cells in the subventricular zone (Fig. 3h). SOX2, TBR2 and NEUROD2 staining revealed that Hs-HARE5 EGFP+ progenitors produced significantly more IPs and neurons but not RGCs (Fig. 3e–k). Together with the cell cycle exit data, these data further indicate that Hs-HARE5 promotes RGC differentiation into IPs and newborn neurons at E15.5. We next used live imaging to quantify E14.5 RGC divisions and progeny generation. As previously done, we used Tbr2–EGFP to monitor IP production, and RGCs were identified as EGFP− dividing cells46,47 (Fig. 3l). After 20 h of imaging, we monitored direct progeny by immunostaining for RGCs (TUJ1−EGFP−), IPs (EGFP+TUJ1−) and neurons (TUJ1+) (Fig. 3m,n). Most control RGCs underwent self-renewing divisions, with additional RGCs undergoing differentiating divisions to produce either IPs or neurons (Fig. 3n,o), as previously observed at this stage46. By contrast, Mm-HARE5Hs/Mm RGCs underwent significantly moresymmetric IP-producing divisions but no significant shift in self-renewing divisions. Although we did not observe increased neurogenic divisions, this may be attributable to the invitro context. These data indicate that Hs-HARE5 promotes increased production of IPs from E14.5 to E15.5, consistent with the IUE lineage analysis. Finally, we assessed the fate of the TBR2+ progenitors. Our data show that Hs-HARE5 increases proliferation of TBR2+ IPs at E14.5 (Extended Data Fig. 6g–j), but that at E15.5, these are not differentiating at high rates (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). To fate map the progeny of these expanded TBR2+ cells in adults, we used an FLP-dependent genetic approach48 (Fig. 3p,q). In the P30 Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices, RFP-labelled progeny significantly increased relative to the control (Fig. 3r). Taken together with the lineage experiments, these data suggest that Hs-HARE5 promotes neuron production by increasing direct neurogenesis from RGCs and indirect neurogenesis through IPs. To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell fate transition from early to mid-neurogenesis, we performed bulk RNA sequencing of E12.5 and E14.5 Mm-HARE5Mm/Mm and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The measurement of differentially expressed genes between E12.5 and E14.5 of both genotypes revealed concordant trends for most transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 9b). This indicates that many genes have similar temporal dynamics across genotypes but show fine-tuning of expression levels. A total of 2,928 transcripts were differentially expressed from E12.5 to E14.5 in both control and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d and Supplementary Table 2), and Gene Ontology analysis showed that these shared transcripts were associated with neuronal maturation (Supplementary Table 2). A total of 1,641 transcripts were significantly and specifically altered in Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs (Extended Data Fig. 9d). These were associated with neural differentiation and cell cycle for upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). By contrast, 564 transcripts were significantly and specifically altered in the control, yet they were associated with distinct categories from Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs (Extended Data Fig. 9d,g). These data suggest that Hs-HARE5 has mild qualitative and quantitative effects on gene expression, aligning with its role as an enhancer. These molecular changes are also consistent with observations of the developmental effect of Hs-HARE5 on RGCs, with reduced cell cycle exit at E12.5 and increased neural differentiation at later stages.
Human variants increase HARE5 enhancer activity
Our data from mouse models indicate that Hs-HARE5 activates RGC expansion and neuron production. A key question is whether this is also true for human NPCs. We first investigated the Hs-HARE5 enhancer activity in human NPCs. Hs-HARE5, Pt-HARE5 and Mm-HARE5
nanoluciferase constructs were transfected into two-dimensional differentiated forebrain cortical NPCs on day (D)10 along with the firefly luciferase vector. Luciferase levels were measured after 24 h (Fig. 4a–c). As expected, Hs-HARE5 was active in human NPCs with a significantly higher twofold activity than both Pt-HARE5 and Mm-HARE5 (Fig. 4d). This parallels the species-specific activity evident in mouse neural progenitors6. HARE5 has four nucleotide changes that discriminate between humans and chimpanzees across the ultra-conserved region. This raises the question of the extent to which each human-specific variant (I–IV) contributes to increased Hs-HARE5 enhancer activity compared to Pt-HARE5. To investigate this, we assayed Pt-HARE5 luciferase reporters, each containing only one human-specific variant (Fig. 4c). Relative to the Pt-HARE5 backbone, human variants I and II significantly increased the activity by almost 60%. In comparison, variants III and IV each showed a 23% increase above the chimpanzee backbone (Fig. 4d). Notably, human variants I and II (dark purple) together led to about 80% increase in enhancer activity relative to Pt-HARE5 and comparable to Hs-HARE5 (Fig. 4d). This indicates that the first two variants have an especially strong role in promoting Hs-HARE5 enhancer activity. Moreover, all four human-specific mutations individually acted with the same directional impact, which could be consistent with independent directional selection of each variant. De novo copy number variations and biallelic point mutations within HARs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)19. Using HARHub5, we determined that Hs-HARE5 contains five ASD variants, including two substitutions and three insertions and deletions19 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). One ASD-associated variant (T>C) was directly adjacent to site I in Hs-HARE5 and predicted to influence the same transcription factor binding site6 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 10b). Luciferase assays revealed that this mutation significantly decreased the Hs-HARE5 enhancer activity (Fig. 4e). These experiments reinforced the functional importance of the Hs-HARE5 locus for enhancer activity in human NPCs.
HARE5 modifies human and chimpanzee NPCs
Having established human NPCs as a model for studying Hs-HARE5, we tested the function of Hs-HARE5 in human cortical development. For this, we generated Pt-HARE5 knock-in human embryonic stem cells (ES cells) (H9 cells) using CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 11a–c). Karyotyping, reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR) and OCT4 staining confirmed that the knock-in cells were healthy and pluripotent (Extended Data Fig. 11d). We used these lines to assess the requirement of Hs-HARE5 in NPCs. For this, we generated human NPCs49 from two control Hs-HARE5Hs/Hs lines, including a parental H9 cell line and a non-edited CRISPR line, as well as from three independent Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt lines (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 11f). Forebrain cortical identity was confirmed by upregulation of FOXG1 and PAX6 and downregulation of OCT4 (Extended Data Fig. 11g–i). FZD8 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in D12–14 Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt NPCs compared with those in controls (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 11j). By contrast, we observed no effect on CCNY levels (Extended Data Fig. 11k). Thus, chimpanzee HARE5 knock-in specifically reduced the expression of its target gene (FZD8) in human NPCs. This is consistent with the function of this enhancer in promoting FZD8 expression and reduced enhancer activity of Pt-HARE5 in mice and human NPCs6 (Fig. 4d). We then tested whether the four chimpanzee variants in HARE5 affect human neurogenesis. Our mouse experiments revealed that Hs-HARE5 promoted mitosis in early-stage RGCs (Fig. 2d–h). We predicted that if this is true in human cells, replacing Hs-HARE5 with Pt-HARE5 would reduce human NPC proliferation. Indeed, we quantified significantly fewer mitotic Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt NPCs relative to the control (Fig. 4g,i).

This finding demonstrates that Hs-HARE5 is essential for promoting NPC proliferation, which is consistent with the observations in mice. Next, we measured how human HARE5 affects human neurogenesis in D30 cortical organoids50, generated using two control lines and two Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt lines (Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 11r–t). Immunostained sections showed the expected SOX2+ neural rosette structures (Fig. 4k). Notably, compared with the controls, Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt organoids contained significantly fewer RGCs surrounding the neural rosettes (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 11u). Moreover, PH3 and SOX2 co-staining revealed significantlyfewer mitotic RGCs in Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt organoids than in the control (Fig. 4m). These findings are consistent with the observations of two-dimensional human NPCs. In summary, these experiments demonstrated that only four chimpanzee-specific variants were sufficient to reduce the proliferative capacity of human neural progenitors. Next, we performed an orthogonal experiment by modifying the Pt-HARE5 locus in chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) and assessing NPCs. Towards this, we generated Hs-HARE5 knock-in chimpanzee iPS cells by replacing Pt-HARE5 with CRISPR–Cas9(ref. 51) (Fig. 4n). We then produced chimpanzee NPCs from two control Pt-HARE5Pt/Pt lines, including parental C3649 cells and a non-edited CRISPR line, as well as one modified Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs line15,52 (Fig. 4o and Extended Data Fig. 11l). FOXG1 and PAX6 were upregulated in D15 NPCs, whereas OCT4 was downregulated, confirming the forebrain identity (Extended Data Fig. 11m–o). Notably, FZD8 mRNA levels were significantly increased in D15 Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs NPCs compared with those in controls (Fig. 4p and Extended Data Fig. 11p). We also observed a significant increase in CCNY levels in chimpanzee NPCs (Extended Data Fig. 11q), which suggests that the chimpanzee NPC environment differentially affects target gene regulation by Hs-HARE5. Thus, human HARE5 knock-in in chimpanzee cells significantly increased the expression of its target gene (FZD8). This is consistent with the amplified enhancer activity of Hs-HARE5 observed in mice and human NPCs6 (Fig. 4d). We then measured the effect of Hs-HARE5 knock-in on the proliferation of D19 chimpanzee NPCs (Fig. 4o). Using SOX2 and PH3 staining, we quantified significantly increased mitosis of Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs NPCs compared with the control (Fig. 4q). Quantification of EdU and KI67 revealed significantly fewer Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs NPCs that exited the cell cycle (Fig. 4r–t). Thus, the presence of only four human-specific variants within chimpanzee cells is sufficient to enhance the self-renewal and mitosis of neural progenitors. These findings were consistent with the increased mitosis and self-renewal of RGCs at the onset of neurogenesis in E12.5 Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs mice. These data reinforce the critical role of Hs-HARE5 in promoting the expansion of early-stage progenitors.
Hs-HARE5 activates canonical WNT signalling in RGCs We investigated the downstream mechanisms by which Hs-HARE5 affects neurogenesis. Frizzled receptors transduce WNT signals, and canonical WNT signalling promotes progenitor expansion in the developing cortex25,27,28. Thus, we propose that Hs-HARE5 increases canonical WNT signalling in NPCs to promote proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a TCF/LEF:H2B-EGFP canonical WNT reporter53, together with pCAG-mCherry (to demarcate electroporated cells) into D10 edited human NPCs (Fig. 5a). The sensitivity of this reporter was validated in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells using the canonical WNT inhibitor IWR1 (ref. 54) (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Compared with the control, we detected a significant decrease in mCherry+EGFP+ Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt human NPCs (Fig. 5b,c). This indicates that Pt-HARE5 reduces canonical WNT signalling in early-stage human NPCs. We then tested the extent to which Hs-HARE5 promotes canonical WNT signalling using in vitro and in vivo analyses of early-stage mouse cortical progenitors. First, we electroporated E10.5 primary cortical neural progenitors with the same canonical WNT reporter and mCherry plasmid and measured signalling 1 day later (Extended Data Fig. 12c–e). Compared with the control, Hs-HARE5 increased
canonical WNT signalling, as evidenced by the higher fraction of mCherry+EGFP+SOX2+ RGCs. To measure canonical WNT signalling with spatial resolution in vivo, we crossed Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs mice with TCF/LEF:H2B-EGFPcanonical WNT reporter mice53 (Fig. 5d). Quantification revealed that canonical WNT signalling significantly increased in the germinal zone of the E10.5 Mm-HARE5Hs/Mm cortex, consistent with the in vitro measurements (Fig. 5e). To measure the extent to which Hs-HARE5 affects WNT signalling at later stages of neurogenesis, we next performed IUE at E14.5 with the TCF/LEF:H2B-EGFP canonical WNT reporter combined with pCAG-mCherry to demarcate electroporated cells (Extended Data Fig. 12f). By contrast to earlier stages, at E15.5, canonical WNT signalling in RGCs was similar between the genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 12g,h). These observations indicate that Hs-HARE5 increases canonical WNT signalling specifically in early-stage mouse RGCs when they are largely undergoing self-renewal. To further understand WNT signalling during development, we examined our bulk RNA-seq dataset for WNT ligands25, which are detectably expressed from E12.5 to E14.5 (Extended Data Fig. 12i). Overall, similar ligands were expressed between the control and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices, including some WNT ligands that were reduced at later stages. This is consistent with the findings in human and mouse NPCs that WNT signalling shifts as progenitors differentiate into neurons29,44. Thus, Hs-HARE5 may differentially affect canonical WNT signalling and neurogenesis in response to unique surrounding ligands. Next, we probed whether FZD8 overexpression phenocopies the Hs-HARE5-dependent increase in canonical WNT signalling in early-stage mouse progenitors (Fig. 5f). Overexpression of Mm-Fzd8 in E10.5 primary cortical neural progenitors resulted in fivefold higher Fzd8 levels after 2 days (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 12j). Notably, this was accompanied by upregulation of canonical WNT signalling reporter activity and target gene expression in progenitors (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 12k). These data demonstrated that higher FZD8 levels increase canonical WNT signalling in early-stage neural progenitors, which phenocopies Hs-HARE5. Previous data have demonstrated that increased canonical WNT signalling promotes proliferation and self-renewal of cortical neural progenitors27,28. Therefore, we tested whether modulating canonical WNT signalling using the agonist CHIR99021 (ref. 55) affects the proliferation of D12 human NPCs. As expected, CHIR99021 induced a 1.5-fold increase in canonical WNT signalling in D12 human NPCs, as validated by the WNT reporter (Extended Data Fig. 12l,m). Increasing concentrations of CHIR99021 but not DMSO significantly increased the proliferation of human NPCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5i). This supports the notion that increased canonical WNT signalling promotes the proliferation of NPCs, phenocopying Hs-HARE5.
Discussion
A long-standing question in biology concerns knowing the molecular features that make us uniquely human. Our genome contains thousands of human-specific DNA sequences2–4,56, including approximately 3,000 HARs, which were first computationally identified in 2006(refs. 10–14). However, the invivo function(s) of HARs in the human brain have been elusive. Here we used orthogonal models across three species to demonstrate the direct roles of aHAR in modifying critical events in human brain development. We discovered that Hs-HARE5 contributes to cortical expansion and function by fine-tuning the behaviour of radial glia, which are essential neural stem cells in the brain. Only four nucleotide changes in Hs-HARE5 are sufficient to modulate its enhancer activity. By controlling the levels of FZD8, Hs-HARE5 promotes canonical WNT signalling to amplify progenitor expansion and ultimately increase neuron production. This study indicates that cortical evolution depends on the fine-tuned modification of a key developmental pathway by gene regulatory changes (Fig. 5j).

Hs-HARE5 contains four nucleotides discriminating humans and chimpanzees. These Hs-HARE5 mutations increase the enhancer activity to promote higher FZD8 expression. This results in increased canonical WNT signalling in early-stage RGCs leading to progenitor expansion. At later stages, Hs-HARE5 promotes increased neuron production by expanded RGCs and IPs.

HARE5 and its target gene (FZD8) are predominantly active and expressed within RGCs. At the onset of neurogenesis, Hs-HARE5 promotes RGC expansion by increasing self-renewal. This aligns with the radial unit hypothesis and empirical studies57,58, which argue that an increased founder cell number underlies cortical expansion. As development proceeds, Hs-HARE5 promotes neuron production by increasing both direct and indirect neurogenesis. We observed a biased increase in upper-layer neurons, which is notable given their expansion in primates. Our data indicate that increased cortical neuron number in Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs brains is associated with more independent functional activity, which is in line with other studies40. These changes may provide a basis for increased memory storage and functional parcellation depending on behavioural demand or improved cognitive flexibility59. Future investigations will elucidate how developmental modifications ultimately affect brain function and behaviour. Hs-HARE5 promotes RGC proliferation by activating canonical WNT signalling. Although canonical WNT signalling is essential for RGC self-renewal, shifts in WNT signalling, including the activation of non-canonical pathways, are linked to differentiation26–28. Consistent with this, we observed developmental changes in WNT ligand expression and HARE5-dependent canonical WNT signalling. It remains to be tested whether HARE5 promotes differentiation through non-canonical WNT signalling and/or through exposure to neurogenic cues. More broadly, it is fascinating to consider how converging evolutionary modifications to this central developmental signalling pathway may synergize to fine-tune the features of the human brains55,56. The HARE5 locus has notable modifications associated with evolution and disease. Humans, chimpanzees and gorillas have a segmental duplication containing ancestral HARE5 (ref. 60) of unknown function and which presumably occurred before Hs-HARE5 nucleotide substitutions. The four Hs-HARE5 substitutions were found in both modern and ancient humans (Denisova and Neanderthals)61,62, suggesting that they may impact human features beyond cortical size. Furthermore, the HARE5 locus contains rare denovo ASD-associated variants, which can temper enhancer activity in human NPCs19,21. This is consistent with the notion that molecular and anatomical modifications during evolution are substrates for disease mutations20. In summary, our study broadens our conceptual understanding of brain evolution by demonstrating the molecular, cellular and connectivity changes driven by human-specific gene regulation.

Methods
Animals
All mouse experiments were approved by Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed the guidelines of the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources of Duke University School of Medicine. Plug dates were defined as E0.5 on the morning the plug was identified. The following previously generated mouse lines were used in this study: Emx1-Cre39, Tbr2–EGFP47, Tbr2-2A-Flp knock-in and Flp-dependent Ai65-Frt reporter48 and TCF/LEF:H2B-EGFP Tg/+ (ref. 53). Mm-HARE5Hs/Mm and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs knock-in mice were generated at the Duke University Transgenic Mouse Facility using standard gene targeting techniques on 129/B6N hybrid mouse ES cells. For this, the targeted mouse genome locus is mm9 chr. 18: 8871182–8872410, and the human HARE5 sequence coordination is hg38 chr. 10: 35949193-35950411 (hg19 chr. 10: 36238121-36239339). Genotyping primers specific to the mouse lines are listed in Supplementary Table 3. All mice used in this study were on a C57BL/6J background from F8 or later generations, except the Tbr2-2A-FLP line, which were mixed C57BL/6J and Swiss Webster. The Mm Fzd8 overexpression experiments were performed using the CD-1 strain. No sample size calculation was performed. Data collection was performed by independent investigators using double-blind and randomized analyses. Equivalent sexes were used (not specified), and ages were indicated in the study.
Plasmid construction
The sequences of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and synthetic oligonucleotides used for cloning are listed in Supplementary Table 3. All sequences were validated using Sanger sequencing. All cloning PCR products were amplified using Q5 Polymerase (New England Biolabs; M0491). To construct the vector used for the mFdz8 overexpression, mouse Fzd8 was amplified from mouse cortical complementary DNA (cDNA) and inserted into the pCAG-mCherry vector by the KpnI enzyme site. To construct vectors used for luciferase assays, human, chimpanzee and mouse HARE5 fragments were amplified from the genomic DNA of individual species and inserted into the pNL1.1 vector (Promega) by KpnI and EcoRV enzyme sites. For generating mutations HARE5-I, II, III, IV, V and ASD, HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs; E2621L) was used. Ligated PCR products were inserted into the pNL1.1 vector (Promega) by the KpnI and EcoRV enzyme sites. For CRISPR–Cas9 knock-in of Pt-HARE5 in human ES cells and Hs-HARE5 in chimpanzee iPS cells, guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed using an online tool64 (http://crispor.tefor.net/). Two pairs of gRNAs targeting both the 5′ and 3′ sides of the HARE5 loci (Hs-HARE5 hg38 chr. 10: 35949493–35950111 (hg19 chr. 10: 36238421–36239039); Pt-HARE5 panTro4 chr. 10: 36445861–36446479), referred to as GuideL and GuideR. To clone the guides, the sense and antisense strand oligos for GuideL and GuideR were briefly annealed and phosphorylated, and the duplexes were cloned into pX330-gRNA (Addgene; 158973) by the BbsI site. Colonies were sequence-validated using the U6_F primer. To increase the targeting efficiency, we amplified the whole sequence of the U6_promoter up to the gRNA structure of GuideR and inserted it into the GuideL vector to generate the plasmid pX330-GuideL+R by the BamHI enzyme site. To construct the donor vectors used for CRISPR, human and chimpanzee HARE5 fragments were amplified from the genomic DNA of individual species, and left and right homology arms (approximately 800 bp) were amplified from the genomic DNA of individual species with protospacer adjacent motif site mutated. PCR fragments were ligated using HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs; E2621L) into the pCAG-Puro vector by the XhoI enzyme site.
RNA extraction and RT–qPCR
Mouse embryonic cortices were dissected in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and RNA was purified using the TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 15596026) method. For NPCs and organoids, RNA was purified
using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN; 74034). For the mouse sample, 5 ng of cDNA was used for each qPCR reaction. For NPC and organoid characterization, 15 ng of cDNA was used for each qPCR reaction. The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 3. RT–qPCR was performed using the QuantStudio 3 software.For all experiments, Gapdh was used for normalization.
Lentivirus packaging and transduction
HEK 293T cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + penicillin/ streptomycin was used for lentivirus production. Then, 26.75 μg of transfer vectors (including pCAG dCas9-KRAB-2A-EGFP (Addgene; 92396) and gRNA-mCherry), 20 μg of packaging plasmid (psPAX2) and 6.25 μg of envelope plasmid (pMD2.G) were transfected using PEI MAX (Polysciences; 24765-100) when the cells reached 70% confluence in a 15-cm dish. The virus was collected and concentrated 48 h later. The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS + penicillin/streptomycin was used for lentivirus transduction. Cells were collected 3 days after for RNA extraction.
ChIP–qPCR
The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was seeded in 100-mm dishes. Once the cells reached 70% confluency, they were transduced with lentivirus for pCAG dCAS9-KRAB-2A-EGFP and gRNA-mCherry, as described above. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using ChIP Kit (Abcam; ab500) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cells were trypsinized 5 min at 37 °C, pelleted and fixed in 1.1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to quench the formaldehyde. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, pelleted and sonicated with Bioruptor Pico (B01080010) for 10 min with cycles of 30 s ON and 30 s OFF on ice. After centrifugation, 50 μl of each sample was set aside as input, and the remaining volume was aliquoted into three tubes and incubated overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker with the following conditions: anti-H3 (Abcam; ab1791-2ug; 1:50), anti-H3K27me3 (Abcam; ab6002-3.5ug; 1:28), beads only. The following day, five times pellet/wash cycles were performed. The precipitated DNA was purified from the beads. The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 3.
Single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis
E14.5 cortices were dissected in cold PBS and dissociated using 0.25% trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 25200056). Cell viability and number were counted using a cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The scRNA-seq experiment was aimed at recovering 8,000–10,000 cells from each embryo. Next, cDNA amplification and library construction were performed using the 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′ v.3.1 kit (Genomics), and cDNA libraries were quantified using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (5067-4626) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq. The samples were sequenced to a depth of 40,000–70,000 reads per cell. A total of 22,695 cells from two control samples and 21,211 cells from two Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs samples were used for the analysis, with an average of 2,110 genes detected per cell. The 10x Genomics Cell Ranger count command v.6.1.2 was used to process the FASTQ files and generate filtered count matrices. The count matrices were further processed using Seurat R package v.4.0.5 (ref. 65). Normalization was performed using the SCTransform function with 5,000 variable features along with regression of mitochondrial genes. The datasets were integrated using the IntegrateData function. Principal component analysis was performed using the RunPCA function with 300 principal components. UMAP was generated using the RunUMAP function on the basis of the top 20 principal components. Clusters were obtained using integrated counts with the FindNeighbors function on the basis of the 20 principal components. The FindClusters function was used with a resolution of 1.1. Marker genes were obtained using the FindConservedMarkers function. The percentage of counts derived from MALAT1 transcripts was calculated because high percentages are

indicative of damaged neurons. Cells were considered damaged and removed if more than 5% of their counts were derived from MALAT1. To obtain cluster-specific differentially expressed genes between Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs and control, a pseudo-bulk approach was used66,67. The pseudoBulkDGE function from scran R package v.1.22.1, which performs the edgeR approach for each cluster, was used. The model was designed using ‘y ~ batch + genotype’, with the contrast set as Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs versus the control. A false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05 was used to obtain differentially expressed genes68.
Bulk RNA sequencing and analysis
For the mouse brain samples, E12.5 and E14.5 HARE5Mm/Mm and Mm-HARE5Hs/Hs cortices were dissected in cold PBS, and RNA was purified using TRIzol. For each stage and genotype, three biological replicates were sequenced. The cDNA libraries were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina). RNA-seq libraries were sequenced by MedGenome, on the NovaSeq 6000 (PE100) with 20 million paired end reads, to a depth of approximately 40 million total reads per sample. Reads were aligned to the mm39 genome using STAR69. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed using DESeq2 (ref. 70), comparing the genotypes and stages. DGE lists were extracted for E12.5 HARE5Mm/Mm versus E14.5 HARE5Mm/Mm and E12.5 HARE5Hs/Hs versus E14.5 HARE5Hs/Hs. DGE lists were defined using FDR less than 0.05, with log2(fold change) threshold of 0.5 or not exceeding −0.5 (Supplementary Table 2). Overlapped and specific gene expression changes were defined using BioVenn (https://www.biovenn.nl/) (Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis categories were identified using DAVID Gene Ontology analysis and selected on the basis of an FDR of less than 0.05 (ref. 71). Plots were made using R Script ggplot, and all enriched categories are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
FZD8 expression analysis
Processed bulk RNA-seq data for the human and macaque brains were obtained from a previous study33. Each data point represents a measurement in RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads)taken from a separate sample from a distinct neocortical area (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; inferior temporal cortex; medial prefrontal cortex;orbital prefrontalcortex; superior temporal cortex; ventrolateral prefrontalcortex; primary auditory cortex; inferior posterior parietal cortex; primary motor cortex; primary somatosensory cortex; and primary visual cortex). Statistical analyses were performed on individual data points for human (n = 311) and macaque (n = 257) cortical areas across 34 and 26 brains, respectively. Human samples outside of the macaque age range (as measured by the predicted equivalent human day) were excluded from statistical analysis. Processed bulk RNA-seq data for mice were obtained from a published dataset35. Each data point represents a measurement in RPKM taken from the frontal cortex of a different wild-type mouse per stage (n = 5 for each stage). Mouse sample ages, including E14.5, E18.5, P7, P35 and P70, were matched to the predicted equivalent human day using Translating Time, including cortical neurogenesis heterochrony36. Translating Time does not include adult ages; therefore, the P70 mouse samples were assigned as equivalent to a postnatal year 18 human sample.
In utero electroporation
IUE was performed, as previously described72. Briefly, each E14.5 embryo was injected with 1 μl of a plasmid mix containing 0.01% Fast Green and 500 ng of pCAGGS-EGFP. Electroporation was performed using five 50-ms pulses at 45 V, with a 950-ms pulse interval, applied using platinum-plated BTX Tweezertrodes. Plasmids were produced using Zymo Endotoxin Free Maxiprep kits (D4202).
Cell cycle exit
BrdU (Sigma; B5002) was dissolved in PBS to obtain a 10 mg ml−1 stock. For cell cycle exit, BrdU was administered through intraperitoneal
injection at 50 mg kg−1 to pregnant dams at E11.5, E13.5 or E14.5, and embryos were collected exactly 24 h later at E12.5, E14.5 or E15.5. BrdU was detected through antibody staining. For the in vitro chimpanzee NPC cell cycle exit, EdU was dissolved in PBS to obtain a 10 mg ml−1 stock. Next, 20 μM EdU was added to the neural induction medium on D18, and cells were collected exactly 24 h later on D19. EdU (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A10044) was detected using Click-iT Plus EdU Imaging Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific; C10638).
Primary cultures and live imaging
Primary cortical cell culture was performed, as previously described46,63,73. Briefly, Tbr2–EGFP+ embryos were preselected under a fluorescent microscope. Both E14.5 dorsal cortices were microdissected from each embryo, and tails were saved for genotyping. Cortices were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin for 6 min to create a single-cell suspension. After centrifugation, 100,000 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma; P7280)-coated glass-bottom 24-well culture plates (MatTek; P24G-1.5-10-F). The cells were maintained in an incubation chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 2 h before imaging. Images were captured using a ×20 objective lens every 20 min with a low exposure time for EGFP (30 ms) and bright field (50 ms) for 20–24 h. Cell division was identified, as previously described46, and cell fate determination was performed post-imaging by immunostaining for TUJ1 and endogenous Tbr2–EGFP.
Immunofluorescence staining and image acquisition
For histological analysis, mouse embryos, organoids and NPCs were collected and dissected in cold PBS. P21, P30 and adult animals received transcardiac perfusion with PBS before dissection. Brains were fixed by immersion in a 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution, and the fixation time varied by sample (4 h to overnight for embryonic and adult brains at 4 °C, 3 h for organoids at 4 °C and 15 min for NPCs at room temperature). Following fixation, embryonic brains were washed 3 times in cold PBS for 5 min each, cryoprotected overnight in a 30% sucrose/PBS solution. Coronal cryosections were collected using a cryostat with a variable thickness depending on the experiments (20–30 μm for embryonic, postnatal brains and organoid immunofluorescence). Immunofluorescence was performed, as previously described. Briefly, slides were permeabilized with a 10-min wash in 0.25% Triton-X/PBS. Sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum/ PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was carried out in PBS overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 h at room temperature. For P21 brain section staining, sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was boiled for 15 min before blocking. For adult brains, slices were generated by vibratome to a thickness of 70 μm and blocked in 5% normal goat serum/0.2% Triton-X/PBS for 3 hours at room temperature. BrdU staining was performed after 30 min of boiling in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) before blocking. EdU staining was performed following the protocol from Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 555 imaging kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; C10638). The primary antibodies were anti-NeuN (Cell Signaling Technology; 24307S; 1:300 dilution), anti-Sox2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 14-981182; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-Brn2 (Novus; NBP2-21585; 1:400 dilution), anti-RORβ (R&D Systems; N7927; 1:150 dilution), anti-Ctip2 (Abcam; AB18465; 1:500 dilution), anti-Tbr1 (Abcam; AB31940; 1:500 dilution), anti-Synapsin1 (Synaptic Systems; 106008; 1:200 dilution), DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling Technology; 4084S; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-Sox9 (Millipore; AB5535; 1:2,000 dilution), anti-Olig-2 (Millipore; MABN50; 1:500 dilution), anti-NeuroD2 (Abcam; AB104430; 1:300 dilution), anti-PH3 (Millipore; 06-570; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-Tbr2 (Abcam; ab183991; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-TUJ1 (Covance; MM5-435P; 1:1,500 dilution), anti-BrdU (Abcam; ab6326; 1:200 dilution), anti-BrdU (Cell Signaling Technology; 5292S; 1:300 dilution), anti-KI67 (Cell Signaling Technology; 12202; 1:300 dilution), anti-KI67 (Cell Signaling Technology; 9449S; 1:300 dilution), anti-RFP (Rockland; 600-401-379; 1:2,000 dilution), anti-GFP (Abcam; ab13970; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-OCT4


(Abcam; ab19857; 1:300 dilution) and DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific; D1306; 1:1,000). The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594 Goat anti-Rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A11037; 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor 594 Goat anti-Mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-11032; 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor 555 Goat anti-Rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A31572; 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-Rat (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A21208; 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-Chicken (Thermo Fisher Scientific; SA5-10070; 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-Mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-11001; 1:500 dilution), Alexa Fluor 647 Donkey anti-Rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A31573; 1:500 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 647 Donkey anti-Mouse 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A31571; 1:500 dilution).
Image acquisition and quantification
Images were captured using a ZEISS Axio Observer Z.1 equipped with an Apotome for optical sectioning at ×10 and ×20 with a 3-μm Z-Stack (for brain sections) and no Z-Stack for cells using ZEN 2.6 software. Whole-mount brains were imaged on a Leica M165 FC microscope using Leica Application Suite X. P30 RFP images were captured using a ZEISS 710 confocal microscope for optical sectioning at ×20 with no Z-Stack. SYN1 and DRAQ5 images were captured using a STELLARIS confocal microscope using LIGHTING platform to deconvolve SYN1. Images were captured with identical exposures between genotypes. Some lower-magnification images were captured using tiling across the sample with higher-magnification objectives to obtain a higher resolution. In some cases, this creates appearance of artificial lines. For each experiment, two to four sections were imaged per embryo. Embryonic, P21 and P30 brain section images were cropped (100- to 300-μm radial columns), and brightness was adjusted equivalently across all images in Fiji. Adult brain image processing was done in MATLAB (Mathworks). For DRAQ5 images, image pixel values below the noise floor were set to zero and images were binarized to create a cell mask. Cell counting of brain sections (E12.5, E14.5 and E15.5), WNT reporter analysis and chimpanzee NPC cell cycle exit were performed in Fiji (ImageJ; Java v.1.8.0) using the Cell Counter plugin74. Cell counting of postnatal samples, NPC mitotic islands and organoids was performed using QuPath automatic cell count75 (v.0.4.2 and v.0.5.1) combined with ImageJ. For organoids, we used ×40 objectives to focus on the field (including the rosettes on the basis of SOX2+ clusters) and then quantified the whole field. The QuPath quantification parameters were adjusted as follows: a requested pixel size of 0.1 μm, background radius of 5 μm, minimum area of 12 μm2, maximum area of 200 μm2 and cell expansion of 3 μm, including the cell nucleus. The smoother boundary boxes were not checked. The threshold was set independently for each channel and maintained for each image in the experiment. Raw quantification data were initially processed using Excel (Microsoft v.2501) and then analyzed and graphed using Prism (GraphPad Software 8). For binning analyses, X–Y coordinates were extracted from Cell Counter data, and a script created in R was used to assign positive cells to specific bins using the coordinates of the ventricular and pial borders as references. Bin numbers were reported in an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. All image analyses and quantification were performed in a double-blinded manner and, in some cases, by several investigators.
Human and chimpanzee genomic-edited cell lines
To establish the Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt mutant lines, plasmids pX330-hsGuideL+R (1 μg) and pCAG-Puro-Pt-HARE5 (2 μg) were electroporated into 1 × 10 6 H9 cells using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector kit (Lonza; V4XP3024). Following each electroporation, cells were separated and grown in three wells of a Matrigel-coated (VWR; 354277) six-well plate in mTesR 1 supplemented with 1× CloneR (STEMCELL Technologies; 5888). Three days after electroporation, the cells were selected with 0.5 mg ml−1 puromycin (Sigma; P8833). After approximately 5 days in the selection medium, the cells were switched back to mTesR 1 medium until a single colony was large enough for passage. Single colonies were
picked from the Matrigel-coated 24-well plates. After about 6 days, when the colonies reached approximately 75% confluence in the well, the colonies were split into half for freezing and half for genotyping after dissociation by ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies; 5872). For colony genotyping, genomic DNA was extracted using a Genomic DNA Purification Kit (STEMCELL Technologies; 79020) and first screened by means of PCR (primer pair 1) and EcoRI digestion on the basis of the third substitution having gained an EcoRI enzyme site in chimpanzees. The potentially positively edited homozygote lines were screened by a second round of PCR (primer pair 2), and Sanger sequencing confirmed the substitutions. The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Three homozygote Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt lines were generated from approximately 200 colonies. A control untargeted cell line was maintained from the same CRISPR manipulation. Homozygote colonies were tested by means of karyotype analysis using a Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Genetic Analysis Kit (STEMCELL Technologies; 7550). The segmental duplication of HARE5 was intact in the CRISPR-edited cell lines. Pluripotency was tested through OCT4 immunofluorescent staining. To establish the Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs lines, plasmids pX330-ptGuideL+R (1 μg) and pCAG-Puro-Hs-HARE5 (2 μg) were electroporated into 1 × 10 6 C3649 cells using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector kit (Lonza; V4XP-3024). The selection and genotyping processes were the same as described above. A homozygous Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs line was generated from approximately 150 colonies. A control untargeted cell line was kept from the same CRISPR manipulation.
Cell line maintenance and NPC differentiation
All lines tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination in this study were checked using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza; LT07-518). The following cell lines were used: human ES cell line WA09 (H9) (WiCell), human iPS cell line (8799)76, chimpanzee iPS cell line (C3649) (gift from Y. Gilad)51. ES cells and iPS cell lines were supplemented with mTesR 1 (STEMCELL Technologies; 85850) and normocin (Invitrogen; ant-nr-1). SH-SY5Y immortalized cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11330057) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone; SH30071.03HI) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 15140122). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment.
All ES cells (H9, Hs-HARE5Hs/Hs control, Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-1, Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-2 and Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-3) and iPS cells (8799, C3649, Pt-HARE5Pt/Pt control and Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs-1) were cultured in Matrigel-coated plates with mTeSR 1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies; 85850) in an undifferentiated state. Cells were passaged at a 1:5 ratio by treatment with ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies; 5872) or Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A11105) for maintenance. For human NPC experiments, H9, Hs-HARE5Hs/Hs control, Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-1, Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-2 and Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-3 cells were differentiated into NPCs, as described above with minor changes49. Briefly, 0.8 × 106 cells were seeded onto Matrigel-coated 60-mm plates until they reached 100% confluence (D0). The medium was replaced daily with neural induction medium containing 1 μM dorsomorphin (Sigma; P5499) and 10 μM SB431542 (Selleckchem; S1067). For FZD8 qPCR and mitosis assays, on D8–10, cells were washed with DMEM/F-12, dissociated with 1 mg ml−1 of Dispase II (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 17105041), and clumps were suspended in neural maintenance medium and plated on Poly-O-Ornithine/Laminin-coated 60-mm dishes. All other assays were done on D6. Next, 20 ng ml−1 of bFGF2 was added to the neural maintenance medium for 2 days until neural rosettes appeared. Four days after clumping, human NPCs were washed with DMEM/F-12 and dissociated with Accutase, and 2.5 × 105 cells were plated on Poly-O-Ornithine/Laminin-coated four-well chamber slides (MatTek; CCS-4) for 2 days for subsequent analysis. For the chimpanzee NPC experiments, C3649, Pt-HARE5Pt/Pt control and Pt-HARE5Hs/Hs-1 cells were differentiated into NPCs, as previously described15,52. Briefly, 0.7 × 105 cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated


Article
12-well plates (D0), and the medium was replaced with N2B27 neural induction medium containing 50 ng ml−1 bFGF2 (R&D; 233FB025) and 100 ng ml−1 Noggin (Miltenyi Biotec; 130-103-456) daily. On D15, NPCs were washed with DMEM/F-12, dissociated with Accutase, and 2 × 105 cells were plated onto Poly-O-Ornithine/Laminin-coated four-well chamber slides (MatTek; CCS-4) for 4 days for subsequent analysis.
Cortical organoid generation
Forebrain cortical organoids were generated, as previously described50. Briefly, on D0, H9, Hs-HARE5Hs/Hs control, Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-1 and Hs-HARE5Pt/Pt-2 cells were dissociated to single cells using Accutase, with 9,000 cells per well reaggregated in ultra-low cell-adhesion 96-well plates with V-bottomed conical wells (s-bio; MS-9096VZ) in cortical differentiation medium I. On D0–6, ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies; 72304) was added (final concentration of 20 mM). On D0–18, Wnt inhibitor IWR-1 (Millipore; 681669) and SB43154 (Selleckchem; S1067) were added (final concentrations of 3 and 5 mM, respectively). From D18, the aggregates were cultured in ultra-low attachment culture dishes under orbital agitation in cortical differentiation medium II until D30.
Luciferase assays
Human NPCs, differentiated from the iPS cell line (8799), were split, and 4 × 105 cells were plated on D10 using Accutase on 24-well plates coated with Poly-O-Ornithine/Laminin. On D14, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A12621) and 250 ng of pNL1.1 luciferase plasmids the following day. Next, 250-ng Firefly plasmid was co-transfected to control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed 24 h after transfection using the Nano-Glo Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega; N1551) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The luciferase activity was measured and quantified using a luminescence microplate reader system. For each experiment, the raw value was normalized using the pNL1.1 empty vector. Data were collected from at least three independent differentiations.
WNT stimulation and electroporation of mouse and human NPCs
Human NPCs were generated, as previously described. D10 NPCs were dissociated using Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A11105) for 4 min to create a single-cell suspension. Next, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 24-well MatTek glass-bottom plates (P24G-1.5-14-F) coated with Poly-O-Ornithine/Laminin (Sigma; P4957/L2020). The next day, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), along with 2.5, 5 and 7.5 μM CHIR99021 (R&D system; 442310), was added to each well. The cells were maintained in the incubation chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h before fixation. WNT reporter plasmid (TCF/LEF:H2B-EGFP) was obtained from Addgene(#32610).For human NPCelectroporation, 1 × 10 6 cells and a plasmid mix (750 ng WNT reporter and 500 ng pCAG-mCherry) were used for each well in a 16-well cuvette, and the standard protocol for the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit S (Lonza; V4XP-3032) was followed using pulse code CB-150. Next, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 24-well MatTek glass-bottom plates (P24G-1.5-14-F) coated with Poly-O-Ornithine/Laminin (Sigma; P4957/L2020). E10.5 cortices were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin for 5 min to create a single-cell suspension. For mouse NPC electroporation, 3 × 105 cells and a plasmid mix (562.5 g WNT reporter and 375 ng of pCAG-mCherry or pCAGmCherry-MmFzd8) were used for each well in the 16-well cuvette, and the standard protocol for the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit S (Lonza; V4XP-3032) was followed using pulse code CM-150. Then, 3 × 105 cells were seeded per well in 12-well MatTek glass-bottom plates (P12G-1.5-14-F) coated with 0.1 mg ml−1 poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich; 30,000–70,000 MW). The cultures were maintained in an organoid base medium without small molecules. The cells were maintained in the incubation chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
Wide-field calcium imaging in vivo
Adult mice (older than P65) were used for the functional imaging experiments. Age-matched wild-type littermates and C57BL/6 mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory were used as the controls. All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at 20–22 °C and 30–70% humidity. Adult mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane, after which they were injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV-PHP.eB-syn-jGCaMP7s; Addgene) using a 30-gauge needle. The mice were subsequently returned to their home cage to allow for brain-wide neuronal expression of GCaMP7s. Three weeks after the virus injection, the mice were surgically implanted with a custom-designed headplate for wide-field imaging. The mice were anaesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane, injected subcutaneously with meloxicam (5 mg kg−1 body weight) and placed in a stereotactic frame (Neurostar). A medial incision was made, and the skin was retracted to expose the skull over the dorsal cortex. The exposed skull was cleaned, and three layers of cyanoacrylate glue (Zap-A-Gap CA+; Pacer Technology) were applied to clear the bone. After the glue was dried, a custom-designed titanium headplate was secured onto the skull using Metabond dental acrylic (Parkell) to allow for head restraint during wide-field calcium imaging. Resting-state neural dynamics were captured using wide-field calcium imaging of GCaMP fluorescence77. The exposed dorsal cortex was illuminated using two consecutively strobing light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A blue LED (Thorlabs; M470L5) with a band-pass filter (Semrock; FF01-460/60-25) was used to excite GCaMP fluorescence, whereas a green LED (Thorlabs; M530L3) with a band-pass filter (Semrock; FF01530/43-25) was used to capture total haemoglobin absorption. A Semrock band-pass filter (FF01-565/133-25) was placed in front of the camera to eliminate the GCaMP excitation light. For near-simultaneous imaging of total haemoglobin, the green LED was necessary to remove haemodynamic signals that are known to confound GCaMP data. GCaMP fluorescence was recorded using an Andor Zyla 4.2+ scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor camera and Nikon lens (Micro NIKKOR 60 mm f/2.8D) at 60 Hz. Resting-state imaging, in the absence of any external stimulus, was performed consecutively for 10 min.
Image processing and analysis for calcium imaging
To analyse wide-field neural activity, the haemodynamic confound was first removed from the GCaMP signal using green reflectance, as previously described77. We then performed principal component analysis to denoise the data, and for each mouse, the number of components needed to account for 85% of their respective total variance was maintained. Following this, the data were spatio-temporally clustered in an unsupervised manner using k-means clustering (correlation-based with 120 components, 60 per hemisphere). K-means clustering was used to ensure that any changes in functional parcellation owing to increased neuron number in mice expressing Hs-HARE5 could be detected. To determine the correlation value threshold of independence, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation between each pixel’s neural time course and the average time course of each k-means cluster. The correlation threshold of independence (maximum r between regions) is the maximum value at which a given pixel is correlated with any cluster beyond its own. Thus, the neural activity in a given pixel is considered independent at maximum r because it does not have a stronger correlation with any other functional region other than the cluster to which it belongs. To determine the within-region correlation, Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed on each pixel relative to only the cluster to which they belong. Finally, to contextualize the functional clustering and correlation analyses, we grouped each k-means cluster into known anatomical cortical regions on the basis of the Allen Atlas Common Coordinate Framework. The correlation threshold of independence was then averaged for all regions within a given Allen Atlas Common Coordinate Framework region. The motor regions (M1 and M2) were split rostral-caudally and evaluated separately.


Statistics and reproducibility
The mouse samples were selected unbiased for various experimental conditions. Samples were excluded if they were severely damaged or if the immunostaining signal reflecting technical issues or IUE efficiency was clearly lower than normal. Primary cultured mouse NPCs were excluded from the analysis if the culture did not appear healthy or failed to attach. Mouse experiments were performed using at least two independent litters, with at least three animals for each condition. Human/chimpanzee NPCs and cortical organoid samples were selected on the basis of the RT–qPCR of FOXG1/PAX6/OCT4 levels, and samples were excluded on the basis of FOXG1 levels from each differentiation. Organoids were included when FOXG1 levels were 800-fold higher than those in D0 ES cells (almost all organoids fit this threshold). Human and chimpanzee cell experiments were performed using at least two independent differentiations across multiple cell lines. All analyses were performed in a blinded manner by one or more investigators. No predetermination of sample size was carried out because our research was an exploratory study. The sample sizes are listed in the figure legends. The number of data points, biological replicates and statistical tests used for all comparisons are indicated in the figure legends. The images shown in all figures are representative of at least three independent experiments/brains. Statistical analyses were included in figures for NPC islands or organoids, as standards for iPS cell and organoid experiments. The data source tables also report the statistics when each differentiation is included as an n value. The parametric tests used were two-tailed unpaired or paired Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test and chi-squared test.
