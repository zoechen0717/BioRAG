Candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in microglia demonstrate the most substantial enrichment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) heritability compared to other brain cell types. However, whether and how these genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants contribute to AD remain elusive. Here we prioritize 308 previously unreported AD risk variants at 181 cCREs by integrating genetic information with microglia-specific 3D epigenome annotation. We further establish the link between functional variants and target genes by single-cell CRISPRi screening in microglia. In addition, we show that AD variants exhibit allelic imbalance on target gene expression. In particular, rs7922621 is the effective variant in controlling TSPAN14 expression among other nominated variants in the same cCRE and exerts multiple physiological effects including reduced cell surface ADAM10 and altered soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) shedding. Our work represents a systematic approach to prioritize and characterize AD-associated variants and provides a roadmap for advancing genetic association to experimentally validated cell-type-specific phenotypes and mechanisms.
Genetics of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) are complex, with many variants potentially influencing LOAD with small effect sizes. The observation of substantial enrichment of AD-associated variants at candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) suggests that risk variants likely contribute to pathogenesis by disrupting gene regulation mechanisms1–4. However, it has not been straightforward to identify the cell types in which variant-harboring cCREs function and the target genes they affect, or to quantify their impact on gene expression. It has been even more challenging to interrogate and measure subsequent physiopathological consequences that ultimately result in disease onset or progression. The challenges derive primarily from the following sources. First, genetic loci are themselves hard to decipher as the majority are located in poorly annotated noncoding regions. Second, regulatory sequences often interact with their target genes over long
genomic distances, precluding a straightforward identification of disease-risk genes and limiting the interpretation of noncoding variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Typically, noncoding variants are presumed to affect neighboring genes. However, this nearest gene model is challenged by both experimental and computational evidence5,6. Finally, the complexity of brain tissues makes functional interpretation and mechanistic dissection error-prone, as genetic loci can affect only a subset of cell types during specific cellular and pathophysiological states. As the resident immune cells in the brain, microglia have essential roles in initiating immune responses, surveillance and maintenance of brain homeostasis7. In particular, microglia cCREs consistently exhibit the highest enrichment for AD-associated variants compared to the cCREs identified in other brain cell types1,8.

We treated differentiated microglia-like cells and three innate immune cell types from a healthy donor, with IFNβ (100 U ml −1), to mimic viral-like infection. The transcriptomes of different cell types are well separated and exhibit mirrored patterns of control versus IFNβ-stimulated cells by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), demonstrating the homogeneity of each cell type and interferon responses (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2c). In hPSC-derived microglia-like cells, FCGR1A, TGIF1 and LRP1 are highly expressed and PTPRC, CD163 and MRC1 are lowly expressed, compared to the other three cell types (Extended Data Fig. 2d), further confirming their identity as microglia21. In addition, we observed shared and unique gene groups responsive to IFNβ stimulation in both peripheral myeloid cells and microglia-like cells (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 2). For example, TCF4, IER2, ITM2B and MS4A6A are uniquely upregulated in IFNβ-stimulated microglia-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Finally, microglia-specific responsive genes are enriched in biological pathways involved in regulating neuron death and cytokine-mediated signaling (Extended Data Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3a). IFNβ-responsive genes in hPSC-derived microglia-like cells are highly enriched in multiple disease-associated microglia (DAM) clusters discussed in ref. 18 and microglia samples associated with AD from five additional studies17,22–25 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Furthermore, hPSC-derived microglia-like cells were embedded with primary microglia24 on UMAP (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), and primary microglia and hPSC-derived microglia-like cells showed consistent fold change in cell proportion in AD/control or IFNβ/control for the top three major microglia subclusters, which contributed to a total of ~70% of the cells (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). These results demonstrated that hPSC-derived microglia-like cells shared similar transcriptomic profiles as primary microglia and IFNβ-activated gene expression changes partially mimic DAM-specific expression.
Dynamic transcription and 3D epigenome in microglia upon stimulation
To investigate the mechanism underlying gene expression dynamics in immune response, we generated the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–seq) datasets for control and IFNβ-stimulated WTC11- and H1-derived microglia-like cells
Two most recent AD GWAS reported a total of 37 and 75 risk loci9,10 with a staggering number of candidate noncoding variants. Whether and how these variants affect AD risk gene expression and how these genes contribute to AD pathogenesis remain, for the most part, to be characterized. Although these publications represent by far the most comprehensive AD genetic analysis, variants and genes are prioritized without considering cell-type-specific chromatin interaction between putative risk noncoding variants and gene promoters. More importantly, prioritized genes in these works were not subjected to functional genetics experimental interrogations. In this study, we generated comprehensive annotations of 3D epigenome in well-characterized and physiologically relevant microglia-like cells by human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-differentiation and interferon-beta (IFNβ) stimulation, which were integrated into fine-mapping analysis for the prioritization of AD risk variants. We tested the roles of prioritized variants by single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens and allelic analysis. Furthermore, by prime editing, we provide a functional annotation of rs7922621 contributing to the downregulation of TSPAN14 and AD-related cellular pathological phenotypes.
Results
Differentiated microglia exhibit features of primary cells
To derive microglia-like cells, we used two independent hPSC lines, WTC11 (a male induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line) and H1 (a male human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line), neither carrying ɛ4 allele nor in the top decile for AD risk when compared to unphenotyped individuals of matched continental ancestry11 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These cells stably expressing microglia-specific proteins IBA-1 and TMEM119 (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) present strong phagocytosis function (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d). The transcriptome of hPSC-derived microglia-like cells closely mimics brain isolated microglia in vitro and ex vivo12 compared to other cell types3,11,13–15, confirming that the molecular properties of these microglia are similar to their counterparts from the human brain (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Table 1a). Viral encephalitis exposure is associated with an elevated AD risk16, and interferon signaling is one of the key biological processes involved in AD conditions and responses to AD-relevant challenges17–20.

(Supplementary Table 1b) and annotated cCREs based on chromatin accessibility. hPSC-derived microglia ATAC–seq datasets cluster together with those generated from microglia isolated from the human brain (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Regions with gained (n = 93 at transcription start site (TSS) and 1,152 at distal regions) and lost (n = 17 at TSS and n = 783 at distal regions) chromatin accessibility upon IFNβ stimulation are consistent between WTC11- and H1-derived microglia (Fig. 2a). Regions with gained accessibility are enriched for binding sites of key transcription factors in immune response, including STAT1, IRF1, JUNB, SPI1 and RUNX1 for both distal (Fig. 2b) and TSS accessible regions (Extended Data Fig. 4d). To explore the roles of chromatin interactions in regulating transcriptional changes in response to IFNβ stimulation, we performed genome-wide promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) in control and IFNβ-stimulated WTC11 iPSC-derived microglia-like cells (Supplementary Tables 1c and 4). hPSC-derived microglia are more similar to primary microglia at the chromatin interaction level compared to neurons and oligodendrocytes1 (Extended Data Fig. 4e). In general, the majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; n = 2,993) are not associated with chromatin accessibility changes or substantial chromatin interaction changes (Extended Data Fig. 4f and Supplementary
Table 5). In fact, many of these genes exhibit stable chromatin looping status before and after IFNβ stimulation, with only 3,018 and 205 regions showing either gained or lost interactions with gene promoters (Fig. 2c). Such observation is consistent with the notion that chromatin states and chromatin loops remain stable and cells are primed for rapid transcriptional regulation in response to signal transduction, including heat shock26, tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling27, transforming growth factor-beta signaling28, diverse stimulations in human immune cells29 and development30. Of all 3,811 DEGs upon IFNβ stimulation, 3,556 already exhibited positive chromatin accessibility at promoters in unstimulated conditions, suggesting that these genes are in a poised state for gene activation. For genes with either differentially accessible regions (DARs) or differentially contacting regions (DCRs) after IFNβ stimulation, we divided them into the following four distinct groups: genes with both DAR and DCR, genes with only DAR, genes with DAR but their promoters are not participating in any interactions and genes with only DCR (Fig. 2d). Notably, genes with concurrent changes in distal chromatin accessibility and interaction have significantly higher probability of transcriptional changes (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4g). These results suggest that for genes that are not primed for activation, changes in chromatin states can still have an essential

role in gene regulation. In particular, MS4A6A promoter gained chromatin interaction with a distal open chromatin region, which exhibited increased chromatin accessibility upon stimulation (Fig. 2e,f). Concordant with changes in 1D and 3D chromatin landscape, MS4A6A expression is upregulated by 3.1-fold after IFNβ stimulation (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4h). Interestingly, the distal open chromatin region contains two prioritized AD risk variants, rs636317 and rs636341 (fine-mapping and variant prioritization results described below). Because MS4A6A has an essential role in immune activation and cell survival and MS4A6A expression is lower in patients with AD31, our results suggest AD risk variants can contribute to AD etiology through modulating immune-responsive genes.
AD fine-mapping with microglia epigenomic annotations
We first performed partitioned linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analysis32, observing enrichments of AD SNP heritability in control and stimulated microglia cCREs. Furthermore, promoter-interacting open chromatin regions exhibit substantially higher enrichment than ATAC–seq annotation alone (Fig. 3a), reinforcing the importance of chromatin interaction data for fine-mapping. Meanwhile, in vitro differentiated microglia and ex vivo microglia annotations showed comparable AD heritability enrichment (Supplementary Table 6a). A recent meta-analysis9 identified a total of 37 AD risk loci, including a staggering number of variants computationally prioritized based on colocalization with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and annotation-based fine-mapping. Although the authors integrated published epigenome annotations, they did not specify the cell types where
prioritized variants could function. To address the cell-type-specificity issue in fine-mapping, we performed analysis at these 37 AD loci with two widely used methods PAINTOR33 and functional GWAS (FGWAS)34, using open chromatin regions and chromatin loops from differentiated microglia as input annotation features (Fig. 3b). Seeding from PAINTOR or FGWAS 95% credible set variants (Supplementary Table 6b), we first included their linkage disequilibrium (LD) tags (defined as LD R2 > 0.8) in TOP-LD European (EUR) and then retained only those overlapping microglia ATAC–seq peaks that interact with promoters, leading to a total of 349 unique variants (Supplementary Table 6c,d). Eighty-seven variants located within IFNβ-responsive CREs (either in DARs or DCRs) and 262 variants in cCREs shared between the two cell states. Among these variants, 308 were not prioritized in ref. 9, revealing 181 new risk cCREs (Fig. 3c). The prioritized variants implied 158 expressed (RPKM > 5) risk genes through microglia chromatin loops, with 68 in IFNβ-responsive cCREs and 146 in constitutive cCREs. Biological processes including regulation of vesicle-mediated transport, positive regulation of proteolysis and myeloid cell activation involved in immune response are shared in both gene lists, while positive regulation of catabolic process and amyloid-beta metabolic process are substantially enriched for genes connected within constitutive cCREs, and cell chemotaxis, receptor-mediated endocytosis and antigen processing and presentation are specifically enriched for genes interacting with IFNβ-responsive cCREs (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 3b,c). Similar fine-mapping using ex vivo microglia annotations (PLAC-seq loops2 and open chromatin regions12) prioritized 23 GWAS loci, among which 20 (~87%) loci are shared with loci prioritized with our in vitro annotation (Supplementary Table 6e).

extracted genes with nonzero read counts in >10% of microglia single cells (23 genes are left) and then tested whether these genes are differentially expressed in microglia between 16 AD cases and 13 controls, leveraging single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) from the Religious Orders Study/Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) study35, identifying two DEGs, including INPP5D and RAB1A with false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%, with both genes downregulated among AD cases (Supplementary Table 6f). Due to a small sample size (n = 29 total) and low number of microglia cells per sample (~49 per sample), the statistical power is low. Therefore, significance implies large effect size, while insignificance largely reflects insufficient data. Among all cCREs harboring prioritized AD variants, we also identified 53 that overlap with ATAC–seq peaks with differential accessibility or chromatin interaction strength after IFNβ stimulation, with the MS4A6A locus exhibiting both as shown in Supplementary Table 6g and Fig. 2e. Additionally, we performed fine-mapping on a more recent GWAS study10 and prioritized 1,913 cCREs for future validations (Supplementary Table 6h).
AD variants affect multiple target genes in microglia
We validated prioritized AD risk loci in hPSC-derived microglia-like cells using a combination of CRISPRi screening and targeted scRNA-seq, HyPR-seq36 (Fig. 4a). Because HyPR-seq focuses on genes of interest, it increases the sensitivity for RNA transcripts detection, providing enhanced statistical power to detect subtle changes after perturbing cCREs compared to other whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq methods. We functionally characterize putative cCREs at five AD risk loci, including four fine-mapped loci (PICALM, BIN1, INPP5D and SLC24A4/RIN3), related to AD pathogenesis either through lipid metabolism, endocytic pathway, or immune response, and have been considered as risk genes due to their proximity to AD GWAS variants. We also included the TREM2 locus as its strong implication in AD. We designed 16 guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target eight cCREs covering a total of 13 prioritized AD variants, six gRNAs for four genes’ TSS, including BIN1, INPP5D, RIN3 and TREM2, and six nonhuman targeting control gRNAs, with each gRNA having a unique expressing barcode (Supplementary Table 7a). Specifically, we knock-in (KI) a CAG–dCas9–KRAB cassette at the CLYBL safe harbor locus in WTC11 iPSCs. Microglia differentiated from the dCas9–KRAB expressing iPSC line were used for gRNA lentiviral library infection at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. To detect gene expression changes, we designed DNA probes against the exons of the 18 genes (±1 Mbp of tested cCREs with an RPKM value > 5; Supplemen tary Table 7b). We also designed unique DNA probes for each gRNA expression barcode. The probes were hybridized into the cells, and the hybridized probes were amplified and sequenced in single cells and used to quantify gene and gRNA expression levels. We compared the transcription level of AD risk genes between experimental and control gRNA-treated cells to examine the regulatory function of tested cCRE regions (Fig. 4a,b). In total, 5 of 8 tested cCREs have substantial effects on nearby gene expression with CRISPRi perturbation (Supplementary
Table 7c,d), including two cCREs at the TREM2 locus, one cCRE at the BIN1 locus, one cCRE at the RIN3 locus and one cCRE at the INPP5D locus (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). Furthermore, similar levels of gene expression inhibition were also observed when perturbing these five CREs after IFNβ stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Our results reveal that AD risk cCREs can impact multiple genes simultaneously, including cCREs at TREM2, BIN1, RIN3 and INPP5D loci (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 5). For example, CRISPRi perturbations of a cCRE region at the INPP5D locus with five prioritized AD variants by PAINTOR (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 6b) led to substantial downregulation of INPP5D together with neighboring genes including ATG16L1, GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). INPP5D, also known as SHIP1, is implicated in autoimmune disease and cancer37,38, and ATG16L1 is required for the autophagy process in inflammatory response39. Taken together, our results suggest that a single AD risk locus could contribute to AD pathogenesis in multiple biological processes by simultaneously regulating multiple genes.
Synergistic effects of TREM2 enhancer and promoter
Functional validation of two promoter-interacting cCREs (region 1 and region 2) upstream of TREM2 (Fig. 4g) showed that both cCREs have a direct effect on TREM2 expression (Fig. 4h). Interestingly, cells infected with both TSS and region 1 gRNAs (n = 93) exhibit a substantial downregulation of TREM2. In addition, such transcriptional downregulation is more pronounced compared to cells only with TSS perturbation (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The synergistic effects of TSS and regions 1 on TREM2 expression are confirmed in both H1- and WTC11-derived microglia-like cells either with or without IFNβ stimulation (Fig. 4i), Simultaneous perturbation of TREM2 TSS and region 1, while downregulating TREM2 expression, affected neither microglia phagocytosis nor proliferation in both resting and stimulated conditions (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although cells receiving two distinct gRNAs are rare in our experiment, such analysis stresses the importance of test cCREs in combination to fully reveal their functionalities.
AD risk SNPs show allelic imbalance in gene expression
To assess the functional impact of additional prioritized AD risk variants, we leveraged the haplotype-resolved WTC11 (ref. 3) and H1 (ref. 40) genomes to identify AD prioritized variants that are heterozygous in either genome, where we can assess the allelic effect on nearby gene transcription. Luckily, we identified 25 loci with 118 prioritized variants heterozygous in either the H1 or WTC11 genome. In total, 114 of the 118 WTC11 or H1 heterozygotes have a reasonable number of allelic reads and have some neighboring genes expressed (RPKM > 5) in microglia-like cells for allelic expression imbalance (AEI) testing. Among the 114 variants, we found 90 (78.9%) variants showing nominal (raw P < 0.05) AEI with at least one gene in the ±1 Mb neighborhood (Supplementary Table 6i). Using an FDR 5%, 51 remained significant.

Following the same procedure as for the 114 variants, we performed genome-wide allelic expression analysis, where we in total tested AEI for 1,204,907 and 1,721,957 variants in H1 and WTC11, respectively. In total, 598,167 (~49.6%) and 941,551 (54.7%) variants show AEI evidence (raw P < 0.05), significantly lower (Fisher test, P = 1.29 × 10−7) than the 78.9% for the 114 prioritized variants. Many heterozygote–gene pairs cannot be tested because of no or limited allelic reads, due to a combination of few exonic heterozygotes and short exon lengths. In addition, AEI
results in WTC11- and H1-derived microglia-like cells are not comparable due to different haplotype backgrounds. For example, variants rs7922621 and rs7910643 are located at the same ATAC–seq peak. In H1-derived microglia-like cells, the P1 risk haplotype exhibits reduced chromatin accessibility than the P2 nonrisk haplotype (Fig. 5a–c), suggesting that AD variants can potentially affect target gene expression via altered open chromatin status. Indeed, TSPAN14 expression is consistently lower with alleles

across prioritized AD variants from the P1 haplotype, suggesting cis regulation of these variants on TSPAN14 (Fig. 5d). We further performed prime editing41 to convert rs7922621 and rs7910643 risk alleles individually to the nonrisk alleles (A/C to C/C for rs7922621 and A/G to G/G for rs7910643) in H1 (Fig. 5e). AEI can be partially restored in microglia differentiated from clones with KI homozygous nonrisk allele for rs7922621 but not for rs7910643 (Fig. 5f). In addition, the total TSPAN14 expression level is increased in rs7922621 edited but not in rs7910643 edited microglia-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Similarly, after prime editing of rs7922621 in WTC11 (A/A to A/C), the edited nonrisk allele also exhibited elevated expression of TSPAN14 from the nonrisk allele (C) compared to risk allele (A) in microglia-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Combined, rs7922621 but not rs7910643 is the causal variant that leads to TSPAN14 downregulation.
Our analysis highlights the importance of characterizing variants at the base-pair resolution.
rs7922621 affects physiological functions in microglia
TSPAN14 interacts with ADAM10 and promotes ADAM10 maturation and trafficking to the cell surface42. ADAM10 has multifaceted roles relevant to AD, including shedding the ectodomain of TREM2 to convert it to sTREM2 (ref. 43). Because higher sTREM2 levels are associated with protection against AD pathogenesis44–47, microglia-like cells differentiated from H1 with rs7922621 risk allele (A/C) indeed have substantially lower levels of cell surface ADAM10 compared to the isogenic microglia that are homozygous for the nonrisk allele (C/C; Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). Instead, microglia-like cells from prime-edited clones at rs7910643 didn’t show differences of membrane

ADAM10 levels compared to the H1 wild-type (WT)-derived microglia (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8e). Furthermore, sTREM concentration is also reduced in conditioned medium of microglia-like cells carrying the rs7922621 risk allele (A/C) compared to the cells with the nonrisk alleles (C/C), while microglia-like cells had no difference on shedding sTREM concentration between clones with rs7910643 A/G and G/G (Fig. 5h). Several genes in the TSPANC8 subgroup are known to regulate ADAM10 maturation48 with TSPAN15, TSPAN17 and TSPAN33 are expressed in microglia-like cells (RPKM > 5). However, we didn’t observe expression changes for other TSPAN genes between control and edited microglia-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f), excluding the possibility that changes of cell surface ADAM10 could be affected by other TSPAN genes and establishing a direct link between TSPAN14 expression and cell surface ADAM10 levels. While, rs7922621 prime-edited clones from H1 and WTC11-derived microglia-like cells exhibit no differences in phagocytosis and proliferation between isogenic microglia pairs, with or without IFNβ (Extended Data Fig. 9). Thus, our results support the model that rs7922621 affects the regulatory function of its cCRE as an TSPAN14 enhancer, which in turn affects ADAM10 maturation. The reduced cell surface ADAM10 level further contributes to the lower shedding sTREM level in microglia, which ultimately contributes to increased risk for AD (Fig. 5i).
Discussion
Our study started with fine-mapping analysis leveraging 3D epigenomic annotation information in microglia. Although fine-mapping (either annotation-free or annotation-based) and variant and gene prioritization have been carefully conducted in multiple published studies9,10,49,50, our fine-mapping is unique in at least the following three aspects, leading to enhanced power to identify microglia-specific variants and regulatory elements. First, we focused squarely on epigenomic annotations from microglia. In contrast, published studies largely relied on general annotations that are mostly not specific to microglia and did not consider cell-type-specific chromatin interactions9,10. Our LDSC results, showing substantially more pronounced enrichment in open chromatins also involved in chromatin loops (enrichment score >80 versus ~40 in open chromatins alone), strongly suggest the value of using cell-type-specific chromatin loop information in fine-mapping. Second, our epigenomic profiles before and after IFNβ stimulation allow for the identification of AD risk loci that are subjected to immune response. For example, the MS4A6A locus harboring two AD fine-mapped variants exhibited increased chromatin accessibility of a distal open chromatin region, which gained chromatin interaction with MS4A6A promoter, and elevated MS4A6A expression upon IFNβ stimulation. Finally, we included all LD tags for fine-mapped variants based on LD information derived from large-sample deep-coverage whole genome sequencing data in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine project, which was not available for previous studies. Our analysis identified hundreds of previously unreported variants and cCREs in microglia that are relevant to AD, suggesting that fine-mapping with microglia-specific annotations has the potential to reveal additional candidate causal variants, regulatory elements and their effector genes. Future studies with larger-scale GWAS are warranted to gain additional insights. For example, we conducted fine-mapping on results from the latest GWAS study10 and summarized results in Supplementary Table 6h, prioritizing >1,000 cCREs for future functional characterizations. We used hPSC-derived microglia-like cells in this work and acknowledge that these cells mimic but are not primary microglia cells. We further performed LDSC analysis to assess AD heritability enrichment using hPSC in vitro differentiation versus ex vivo microglia annotations. Results summarized in Supplementary Table 6a show that despite some subtle differences, the levels of enrichment are comparable, justifying genetic manipulation of hPSC-derived microglia-like cells in AD functional studies.
Usually, only one gene is assigned as a risk gene for each locus, leaving their pathological relevance to AD largely uncharacterized9,10. We demonstrate that cCREs harboring AD fine-mapped variants can simultaneously regulate multiple genes and suggest that a single risk locus can contribute to AD through multiple molecular and cellular processes. Studies of the combinatorial effect of cCREs are limited to a few well-studied enhancers, including the enhancers at the β-globin locus in K562. In our study, we showed interesting combinatorial effects of cCREs on TREM2 gene expression, highlighting that future studies of combinatorial effects of cCREs should be carried out to offer a more nuanced view of gene regulation of AD risk genes. Our results at the TSPAN14 locus showcase the value of primeediting experiments where only one of the two SNPs residing in the same cCRE manifested a substantial impact on TSPAN14 expression and downstream cellular phenotypes. Such precision is difficult to achieve with epigenome-editing experiments and for this specific example, microglia eQTL results also failed to distinguish the function between the two SNPs that are in perfect LD. Finally, our study advances the functional characterization of AD variants and cCREs beyond transcriptional consequences. Specifically, we examined the impact of rs7922621, the SNP regulating TSPAN14 expression, on multiple AD-relevant physiological phenotypes including the abundance of cell surface protein ADAM10 and sTREM shedding from microglia, advancing GWAS findings to functional mechanisms and pathophysiological insights.

Methods
Ethics statement
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor are used. The study is exempt from continuing UCSF IRB review and approval and from federal regulations (exemption number E4) based 45 CFR 46.101.(b)(4). The use of WTC11 iPSCs and H1 hESCs was approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research Committee at UCSF.
Microglia differentiation and stimulation
Microglia were generated using an established method11. hPSCs reaching 80% confluence were cultured in mTeSR medium (STEMCELL Technologies) containing 80 ng ml−1 bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) (PeproTech, 120-05ET) for 4 d. The cells were next induced with StemPro-34 serum-free medium (SFM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10639011) supplemented with 25 ng ml−1 FGF-basic (bFGF) (PeproTech, 100-18b), 100 ng ml−1 stem cell factor (SCF) (PeproTech, 300-07) and 80 ng ml−1 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (PeproTech, 10020) for 2 d. On day 7 and day 10, the StemPro-34 SFM supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 interleukin (IL)-3 (PeproTech, 200-03), 50 ng ml−1 SCF, 50 ng ml−1 macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (PeproTech, 300-25), 5 ng ml−1 thrombopoietin (TPO) (PeproTech, 300-18) and 50 ng ml−1 FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) (PeproTech, 300-19) were used. From day 10, floating cells were spun down and seeded back to the original wells. From day 15, cells were cultured in StemPro-34 SFM with 50 ng ml−1 M-SCF, 50 ng ml−1 FLT3 and 25 ng ml−1 granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (PeproTech, 300-03). On days 25–35, we seeded the floating cells in advanced Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12633012) with 2 mM Glutamax, 100 ng ml−1 IL-34 (PeproTech, 200-34) and 10 ng ml−1 GM-CSF. We collected floating microglia progenitors every 3 d for 4–6 weeks. Two weeks after reseeding, mature microglia were used for experiments and treated with 100 U ml−1 IFNβ (R&D Systems, 114151). All cells were tested to be free of mycoplasma.
APOE allele status and polygenic risk score (PRS) construction We checked APOE allele status for WTC11 and H1, using genotypes at rs429358 and rs7412. Both donors are nonrisk e3 allele homozygotes. We used PRSice-2 (ref. 51; v2.3.5) and GWAS results in ref. 10 to compute PRS for the two donors, and for individuals of EUR and East Asian (EAS) ancestry from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G). WTC11 has a higher (89.3%) risk PRS within 1000G EAS. H1 has a 79.9% PRS within 1000G EUR, thus not noteworthy elevated or decreased risk. Only variants with P < 5 × 10−8 reported in ref. 10 contributed to PRS calculation, not including rs1990621 (P = 7.03 × 10−7) in the TMEM106B locus. WTC11 is homozygous for the minor allele at rs1990621, which renders protective effects against AD and related dementia (personal communication with M. Ward at National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)).
Immunofluorescence
Cell staining was conducted as previously described3. Primary antibodies against IBA-1 (Abcam, ab5076; polyclonal, 1:500 dilution), TMEM119 (Abcam, ab185333; polyclonal, 1:1,000 dilution) and secondary antibodies including Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin G (IgG; Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11058; 1:800 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21206; 1:800 dilution) were used for immunostaining.
PBMC and microglia scRNA-seq analysis
PBMC was isolated from TRIMA residuals obtained from the Vitalant Research Institute. To prepare monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), we isolated monocytes using the EasySep Human Monocyte Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, 19359). In total, 2 × 106 cells were seeded into six-well plate in 4 ml complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640, 10%
FBS, 1% P/S and 1% Glutamax) containing appropriate cytokines for dendritic cells (GM-CSF: 100 ng ml−1; IL-4: 100 ng ml−1) and macrophage (GM-CSF: 100 ng ml−1) and incubated for 5 d. On the day of IFNβ stimulation, fresh monocytes were prepared using the same procedure and resuspended in fresh complete RPMI 1640 medium. We treated iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, MoDCs, MDMs and fresh monocytes with IFNβ (100 U ml−1) for 6 h. Multiplexed single-cell sequencing with cell hashing was performed as follows. Cells were first blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, 422302) in cell staining buffer (BioLegend, 420201) for 10 min on ice, followed by staining with an individual TotalSeq-A antihuman Hashtag for 45 min on ice. In total, 1.25 × 105 cells were pooled from each group with an average viability of 85%. Single-cell suspension (6.4 × 105) cells were loaded into 10X Chromium Controller following the manufacturer’s user guide (document CG000185 Rev B) using Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3. scRNA-seq and hashtag barcode libraries were constructed following the manufacturer’s user guide (document CG000185 Rev B) and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 to get a total of 2 × 109 reads. Sequencing data from each lane was processed separately and then aggregated using Cell Ranger software (v3.0.2), to generate matrices of unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts for RNA and hashtags across all cells. We leveraged hashtag counts to remove doublets using Seurat52 (v4.1.1). We further removed cells with >8% mitochondrial transcripts, <200 or >4,500 features, leading to 27,300 cells for analysis. Top ten principal components (PCs) were selected for clustering based on PCElbowPlot, and clusters were computed at a resolution of 0.5. We assigned cell types based on feature genes in each population. FindMarkers function was used for comparing DEGs. We pooled 4,126 microglia from ref. 24 with 3,038 WTC11-derived microglia-like cells and used Seurat FindIntegrationAnchors and Harmony53 (v0.1) for integration analysis. To compare the cell count fold change in different conditions within each cluster, we performed the Monte Carlo permutation test (https://github.com/rpolicastro/scProportionTest).
Motif analysis
DARs were categorized into TSS or distal peaks based on Gencode v19 TSS annotation using BEDTools52 (v2.29.2). Motif enrichment was done using HOMER54 (v4.11.1). The hypergeometric distribution was used for motif scoring using the entire genome as a background.
RNA-seq
In total, 1 μg of RNA was used to prepare libraries using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, 20020594). Paired-end 150 bp (NovaSeq 6000) reads were aligned to hg19 using STAR (v2.7.2b2) with ENCODE settings, and strand-specific transcript quantification was performed using RSEM (v1.3.13) with GENCODE v19 annotation. Reads were trimmed to 100 bp using fastp (v0.20.1). Trimmed mean of M-values (TMM)-normalized RPKM values were calculated by edgeR55 (v3.32.1). The mean gene expression across all replicates was used for each cell type.
ATAC–seq
ATAC–seq was carried out using the Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, FC-121-1030) as described56. In total, 150 bp paired-end (Novaseq 6000) reads were trimmed to 100 bp, mapped to hg19 and processed using the ENCODE pipeline (v1.10.0). The raw peaks called by Model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS) with P value < 0.01 were used for analysis.
pcHi-C
pcHi-C was carried out as described3. In total, 150 bp paired-end reads (NovaSeq 6000) were trimmed to 100 bp using fastp (v.0.20.1). To assess the reproducibility between replicates, we used HPRep57 (v1.0). Significant chromatin interactions were called using CHiCAGO

(v1.20.0; score ≥5)3. To check chromatin interaction similarity across cell types, we used Bedtools ‘pairtopair’ function and quantified similarity using the Jaccard index.
DEGs, DARs and DCRs
DEG analysis was performed using DESeq2 (ref. 58; v1.30.1) on raw count expression outputs from RSEM (v1.3.13). We kept only rows with ≥10 reads. Significant DEGs were defined by adjusted P value < 0.05 and log2(fold change) > 0.5. DCRs were identified using DiffBind59 (v3.0.15). We built consensus ATAC–seq peaks from control and IFNβ treated microglia-like cells using BEDTools merge (v2.29.2). Reads in the consensus peakset were normalized and compared using edgeR. DCRs were identified using Chicdiff60 (v0.6) with contact matrices and CHiCAGO outputs. Significant DCRs were defined by adjusted P value < 0.05 and log2(fold change) > 0.5.
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis GO analysis was performed with clusterProfiler61 (v3.18.1). Microglia-specific IFNβ responsive genes (n = 72) were used as input compared to a genome-wide background gene list (n = 31,438). Expressed genes that physically interact with fine-mapped AD variants (n = 158) were compared to all genes forming long-distance interactions in microglia-like cells (n = 19,329). GO terms for each category with q value < 0.05 are reported. Reference genes were collected from various studies17,18,22–25 of DAM signatures.
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
CCA was done using SMCCA-GS62 adapted from SMCCA implemented in the PMA R package.
Stratified LD score regression
We leveraged stratified LDSC32 (v1.0.1) to examine heritability enrichment in regions with epigenomic annotations specific to microglia-like cells with and without IFNβ stimulation, iPSC-derived excitatory neurons and primary astrocytes. We jointly quantified heritability enrichment for the four cell states, for variants in each of the following two annotation strata: (1) ATAC–seq peaks; (2) nonpromoter ATAC–seq peaks overlapping pcHi-C loop(s).
GWAS fine-mapping
We performed fine-mapping at 37 AD loci9 using PAINTOR33 and FGWAS34, using pcHi-C chromatin loops and ATAC–seq peaks iPSC-derived microglia-like cells.
FGWAS
We ran FGWAS (v0.3.6) after excluding variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤ 0.5% and multi-allelic variants, using ATAC–seq and pcHi-C annotations from control microglia-like cells. We first retained regions with regional-PIP > 0.95, and within each retained region, we included top variants until the sum of variant-PIPs ≥ 0.95. We refer to these variants as FINEMAP 95% credible set variants.
PAINTOR
PAINTOR (v3.0) was separately run for each of the 37 loci9 with ATACseq and pcHi-C annotations. Two loci (HLA and PILRA) had convergence issues and therefore had no PAINTOR results. We used LD reference from EUR samples in the 1000 Genome Project. We normalized PAINTOR variant-PIPs by dividing raw variant-PIPs by the sum over a locus, separately for each locus. Within each locus, we included top variants until the sum of normalized variant-PIPs ≥ 0.95. We refer to these variants as PAINTOR 95% credible set variants.
LD tags for credible set variants
We merged FINEMAP and PAINTOR 95% credible set variants, resulting in a total of 6,200 seeding variants. Because causal variants can be LD
tags of these variants, we augmented the seeding variants with their LD tags (LD R2 > 0.8 in the EUR population in TOP-LD63).
Variant prioritization and further annotations
After merging FINEMAP and PAINTOR’s 95% credible sets and adding LD tags, we further short-listed by selecting variants with the highest PIP from either FINEMAP and PAINTOR, variants with the highest PIP among those residing in cCREs not prioritized in ref. 9, and finally variants whose eQTL and chromatin interactions suggest the same gene(s). We have recently reported64 that concordant eQTL and chromatin interaction evidence corresponds to higher probability to be functional. We further required all these genes to be expressed in microglia (RPKM > 5). These criteria reduced the number of prioritized variants down to 349. For each prioritized variant, we provided their ATAC–seq, pcHi-C and primary microglia eQTL information from refs. 25,65.
Differential expression in microglia between AD cases and controls
We tested whether genes implicated by prioritized variants are differentially expressed between AD cases and controls in microglia using ROS/MAP snRNA-seq data containing 16 AD cases and 13 controls and a total of 1,341 microglia cells35. TWO-SIGMA66 (v1.0.2) was used to detect DEGs, adjusting for age, sex, race and cellular detection rate. For each prioritized variant, we considered genes whose promoter contains the variant or forms chromatin loop(s) with the cCRE harboring the variant. We further restricted to genes expressed (RPKM > 5) in iPSC-derived microglia and have nonzero read counts in >10% single cells, leading to 23 testable genes. Using published prefrontal cortex expression profiles from 129 patients with AD and 101 controls using the Rosetta/Merck Human 44k 1.1 microarray67, we normalized expression (log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference) and used limma for DEG analysis. Among the 23 genes with nonzero read counts in >10% microglia cells, 93% (28 of 30) probesets tested showed significant DE. For the 158 linked genes, 81% (126 of 156) probesets tested showed significant DE. These results suggest a large overlap between linked genes and DEGs. The two DEGs identified in the snRNA-seq data, INPP5D and RAB1A, remained significant in the microarray data with consistent directions.
KI dCas9–KRAB in WTC11 and H1 hESC lines
A dCas9–KRAB cassette driven by CAG promoter (modified from Addgene, 89567) was integrated into the CLYBL safe harbor locus to enable robust transgene expression in WTC11 and H1 using TALENs (pZT-C13-R1 and pZT-C13-L1; Addgene, 62196 and 62197). Heterozygous WTC11 and H1 clones with dCas9–KRAB KI with normal karyotyping were used.
HyPR-seq
The HyPR-seq was performed according to the published protocol36. Four pairs of ssDNA probes for each target gene were designed using HyPR-seq pipeline (https://github.com/EngreitzLab/hypr-seq). We sequenced ~5,000 reads per cell covering 18 target genes and 28 gRNA barcode sequences. HyPR-seq pipeline was used to generate a singleton UMI count matrix, and in each run, ~10 k singletons were analyzed. Raw UMI counts were first normalized by the total counts in each cell and scaled by 1,000. To assign the correct gRNA to each cell, we first obtained a credible set of positive cells for each gRNA, in which the positive gRNA count must be over sixfold compared to the second enriched gRNA. Next, we re-assigned positive gRNA identity to all cells if the gRNA count was over the first quantile of the gRNA count distribution in the credible set. About 60% of the cells were successfully assigned with an individual gRNA. To pool count matrices from different batches, UMI counts for each target gene were normalized by the average UMI counts among all negative control gRNA-infected cells within that batch68. Finally, CRISPRi effects were detected between enhancer perturbed

versus negative control cells. P values are calculated using two-sided two-sample t test and adjusted by Benjamini–Hochberg FDR multiple testing correction. Adjusted P value (FDR) < 0.05 is used as a cutoff.
CRISPRi and expression analysis
gRNAs are designed using GuideScan69. In bulk validation, gRNA was inserted into CROP-seq-opti vector (Addgene, 106280) and packaged into lentivirus. In the single-cell CRSIRPi screening, gRNAs were inserted into 28 barcoded HyPR-seq vectors36 separately, evenly pooled and packaged into lentivirus by cotransfection with pMD2.G and psPAX (Addgene, 12260 and 12259) into lentiX 293T cells (Takara Bio, 632180) using PolyJet (Signagen, SL100688). Virus-containing medium was collected every 24 h for 3 d, spun to remove debris and filtered with 0.45 μm filter and concentrated by Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore, UFC901024). The virus titration was performed by antibiotics selection and calculated by microglia survival rate and seeding density. Microglia-like cells were treated with 500 ng ml−1 puromycin for 4 d after infection. In the bulk validation, we used a MOI of 3.0 and microglia from at least three independent differentiations. In the CRISPRi screen, we used a MOI of 0.5 using three batches of independently differentiated microglia-like cells.
Prime editing
Prime editing was conducted as previously described41. pegRNA and ngRNA were designed by PrimeDesign70. We used the following template to link the two spacer sequences as the forward guide oligo: CACC (ngRNA spacer) GTTTAGAGACGTTCGAAAGCGTCTCACACC (pegRNA spacer) GTTTTAGAGC (Supplementary Table 8). The annealing guide oligo, coupled with annealing oligos for pegRNA extension and evopreQ1, were ligated into a BsmBI-digested custom acceptor vector with a mCherry marker. The resulting plasmid was linearized by BsmBI-v2 (NEB R0739L) and ligated with a DNA fragment containing tracRNA(E/F) and the human U6 promoter fragment to construct the pegRNA/ngRNA co-expressing plasmid. Two million cells were transfected with 5 μg pegRNA/ngRNA plasmid and 5 μg PE2-expressing plasmid with GFP marker using P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza, V4LP3002). Two days after transfection, cells with GFP+/mCherry+ signals were sorted into Matrigel-coated 96-well plates by FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). Two weeks after transfection, the genotypes of clones were verified by PCR and Sanger sequencing.
Allelic expression and chromatin accessibility imbalance analysis
We performed AEI analysis for the 118 SNPs heterozygous in either H1 or WTC11. To mitigate reference allele bias, we adopted the allele-specific pipeline for unbiased read mapping and molecular QTL discovery (WASP)71 (v0.3.4) method. Leveraging H1 and WTC11 haplotypes, we tested allelic imbalance for each of the 76 and 46 heterozygous SNP with every expressed (RPKM > 5) gene in the neighborhood (±1 Mb), when allelic reads in exonic regions exceed five. Similarly, we used WASP for ATAC–seq data in H1-derived microglia-like cells and tested allelic imbalance using the binomial test.
Allelic analysis of gene expression in prime-edited microglia Allelic expression was evaluated in H1 and WTC11-derived microglia-like cells with desired edits. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, 74034) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, 1708891). The region with heterozygous SNPs in exons of the target genes was amplified, purified, added with Illumina adaptors and deep sequenced. Paired reads were aligned to the target sequences using BWA (v0.7.17), and the aligned reads with either allele were counted by exact match. We used published haplotypes for H1 (ref. 40) and WTC11 (ref. 3). Haplotypes between rs7922621 and rs12411484 were manually determined by Sanger sequencing. All primers are listed in the Supplementary Table 8.
Microglia phagocytosis assay
We incubated microglia-like cells with diluted latex beads (rabbit IgGFITC complex; Cayman, 500290) at 37 °C for 2 h. Trypan blue solution was added for 2 min to quench cell surface FITC fluorescence, followed by one wash with assay buffer. We then removed microglia from the dish by gentle scraping and analyzed them on a LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Ki-67 flow cytometric analysis
Cells were washed with PBS and disassociated with ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies, 05872) before fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100 (SIGMA, T8787) for 10 min. Cells were then incubated with 0.25 μg Ki-67-FITC monoclonal antibody (SolA15; Invitrogen, 11-5698-80; 0.25 μg per test) for 1 h at room temperature in dark before FACS.
Surface ADAM10 flow cytometric analysis
Microglia-like cells were washed three times with PBS and scratched from the plates. Cells were first stained with anti-ADAM10 (EPR2349174; Abcam, ab252234; 1:400) using 100 μl staining buffer (PBS with 5% FBS) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, A21206; 1:800) in a 100 μl staining buffer for 30 min on ice. Cells were incubated with SYTOX Blue dead cell stain solution (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C and analyzed by LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). ADAM10 levels were quantified initially using FlowJo software (v10.8.1). rs7922621 and rs7910623 edited cells were compared to the WT cells. We log-transformed the raw ADAM10 levels, followed by quantile normalization to ensure WT levels follow the same distribution across replicates. Finally, we performed a one-sided (edited > WT) two-sample Wilcoxon test on median ADAM10 levels from the five replicates.
Assay for sTREM2
We used the Human TREM2 assay (BioTechne/ProteinSimple, SPCKB-PS-001847) on the Ella system according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Conditioned medium was collected after overnight incubation with microglia-like cells and removing cell debris via low-speed spin. The samples were diluted twofold with a diluent buffer provided by the manufacturer. In total, 50 μl of the diluted samples were loaded on the Simple plex human TREM2 cartridge. The raw data were collected from the Ella automatic immunoassay instrument. The levels of human sTREM2 in the samples were determined by Simple Plex Explorer software and further normalized by the cell numbers. The experiment was repeated with microglia-like cells from three batches of independent differentiations.
Statistics and reproducibility
Statistical methods for all analyses performed are detailed in the corresponding Methods section. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, and no data were excluded from analysis except for single-cell data, which were excluded from downstream analyses if they did not pass technical quality control as described in Methods. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Enrichment analysis of IFNβ responsive genes
compared to DAM feature genes. a, Barplots show the q values and enrichment scores of GSEA results for IFNβ responsive genes, in comparison with published datasets17,18,23–26 (dash line, q = 0.05). IFNβ responsive genes are highly enriched in multiple clusters of DAM by Olah et al.18, including the C4 cluster, representing cells with activated IFN signaling, the C7 cluster, representing cells expressing DAM genes, as well as C5 and C6, representing cells expressing genes related to anti-inflammatory responses. The C2 cluster, representing homeostatic microglia which are more likely derived from the temporal neocortex of younger temporal lobe epilepsy patients compared to the other homeostatic population, is also enriched for IFNβ responsive genes. 4 clusters are not enriched for IFN responsive genes, including C1, a homeostatic population shared by all brain regions in all donors, C3, cells with enriched expression of cellular stress genes, C8, cells enriched for respiratory electron transport, and C9 enriched with genes
of cell cycle. In addition, IFNβ responsive genes are enriched in microglia samples associated with AD from 5 additional studies, including microglia samples in the human-MG4 cluster and the mouse-MG4 cluster, which are most enriched with DAM genes among all clusters from Sayed et al.17, the MG0 cluster (highly represented in AD microglia) compared to the MG1 cluster (control microglia) from Zhou et al.23, and AD DAM DEGs from Mostafavi, et al.24, Kosoy et al.26, and Morabito et al.25. b, UMAP plot visualizing integration of 3,038 WTC11-microglia scRNA-seq with 4,126 primary microglia snRNA-seq from Morabito et al.
