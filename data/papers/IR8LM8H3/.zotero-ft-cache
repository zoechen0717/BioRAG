41 Abstract (149/150 words)
42 Response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is associated with several biological pathways,
43 including tumor immunogenicity and antitumor immunity. Identifying host factors involved in
44 these pathways may guide personalized ICI treatment. We describe the application of chromatin
45 conformation assays to blood from patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma from the phase
46 3 JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial (NCT02603432). This trial demonstrated a significant survival
47 benefit with avelumab maintenance plus best supportive care (BSC) vs BSC alone following
48 non-progression with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy. Blood-based
49 chromatin conformation markers (CCMs) were screened for associations with high/low immune
50 effector gene expression in tumors and for interactions with outcomes and tumor mutation
51 burden. Candidate CCMs included genes involved in several immune response pathways, such
52 as POU2F2, which encodes a transcription factor that regulates B-cell maturation. Our findings
53 suggest that polygenic host factors may affect response to ICIs and support further investigation
54 of chromatin conformation assays.

57 Introduction
58 Exploratory analyses of biomarkers from clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
59 have highlighted diverse biological pathways associated with response to ICI treatment;
60 however, identifying biomarker assays that provide optimal predictive response value remains a
61 major challenge [1, 2]. In the phase 3 JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, avelumab first-line (1L)
62 maintenance plus best supportive care (BSC) significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and
63 progression-free survival (PFS) vs BSC alone in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma
64 (UC) without disease progression after 1L platinum-based chemotherapy [3]. Based on these
65 results, avelumab 1L maintenance was established as a standard of care in patients with
66 advanced UC [4, 5].
67
68 Exploratory tumor biomarker analyses from JAVELIN Bladder 100 revealed complex
69 relationships with treatment outcomes, with both innate and adaptive immune biomarkers
70 showing enrichment for response [2]. Assays for individual biomarkers such as programmed
71 death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutation burden (TMB) did not optimally identify patients who
72 were significantly more likely to benefit from avelumab 1L maintenance [2]. Exploratory
73 (hypothesis-generating) analysis suggested that patients with low PD-L1 expression may not
74 have significant OS benefit with avelumab 1L maintenance plus BSC (avelumab plus BSC) vs
75 BSC alone if TMB scores were low (hazard ratio [HR],1.27 [95% CI, 0.799-2.006]), but had
76 significant benefit if TMB scores were high (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.251-0.768]). In contrast,
77 patients with high PD-L1 expression had significant OS benefit even with low TMB (HR, 0.60
78 [95% CI, 0.382-0.955]), suggesting that elevated anti-tumor immunity (high PD-L1 expression)
79 could, in part, compensate for low tumor immunogenicity (low TMB) [2]. However, no molecular
80 biomarkers are currently used to select patients for avelumab 1L maintenance in clinical
81 practice.
82


5
83 As highlighted in the recently updated cancer immunity cycle [6], non-transformed cell types in
84 the tumor microenvironment, including stromal and myeloid cells, have emerged as important
85 modulators of anti-tumor immunity released by ICIs. These findings, made possible through the
86 application of novel technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, support hypotheses that
87 response to ICI may be contingent on host factors such as germline single nucleotide
88 polymorphisms [7], microbiomes [8], and epigenetic modification of the 3-dimensional (3D)
89 structure of chromatin [9-13]. EpiSwitch is an established 3D genomic biomarker platform,
90 based on the original chromosome conformation capture approach, that has demonstrated
91 promising utility in various disease settings [14-19], including response to avelumab observed in
92 a retrospective study [20].
93
94 We employed the EpiSwitch platform to evaluate the hypothesis that epigenetic host factors
95 measurable in peripheral blood may modulate immune activity in the tumor microenvironment of
96 patients enrolled in the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial. A 3-stage process was used: (1)
97 identification of chromatin conformation markers (CCMs) associated with tumor immune gene
98 expression signature; (2) statistical modeling to rank CCMs’ association with TMB and OS
99 following avelumab plus BSC vs BSC alone; and (3) characterization of the expression and
100 function of genes covered by the highest-ranked CCMs.
101
102 Results
103 Study cohort and methodology
104 The JAVELIN Bladder 100 study included 496 patients with tumor transcriptome data whose
105 blood could be analyzed by EpiSwitch (Supplementary Figure 1a). A 26-gene signature (JAV
106 Immuno), identified in JAVELIN Renal 101 and validated in JAVELIN Bladder 100 [2, 21],
107 displayed modulation of the interaction between TMB, OS, and treatment (avelumab plus BSC
108 vs BSC alone) comparable to that of PD-L1 (Figure 1a). In the avelumab plus BSC arm, a


6
109 significant OS benefit was associated with JAV-Immuno levels (high vs low) in patients with low
110 TMB (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.351-0.773]; p=0.0012) but not in patients with high TMB (HR, 1.22
111 [95% CI, 0.756-1.957]; p=0.42). No association was found between either biomarker and OS in
112 the BSC alone arm. JAV-Immuno was therefore chosen as the measure of tumor immune
113 response to probe for CCMs.
114
115 Identification of candidate CCMs
116 The CCM discovery process was conducted as previously described (Figure 1b; see Methods
117 for details) [22]. Patient samples were classified as JAV-Immunohi if the corresponding tumor
118 expression was greater than the sample median and JAV-Immunolo if it was less or equal than
119 the median. Nuclei templates from 20 JAV-Immunohi and 20 JAV-Immunolo specimens were
120 hybridized to an array of >900K oligonucleotides spanning the human genome, thereby
121 identifying 150 loci that could be either positively or negatively associated with the JAV-Immuno
122 classification. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays designed to give a positive
123 reading only if the PCR primer targets were juxtaposed by chromatin conformation were applied
124 to 40 JAV-Immunohi and 40 JAV-Immunolo samples (Supplementary Figure 1a). These nested
125 PCR data were used as a training set to build JAV-Immunohi/lo classifier models. PCR data from
126 the remaining 416 samples were used to refine and test the classifier models. The models with
127 optimal test accuracy (0.68) contained 25 CCMs (Figure 1c). Univariate analysis of CCM
128 association with JAV-Immuno scores indicated that individual CCMs could be either positively or
129 negatively associated with JAV-Immuno, depending on the detection titer dilution, suggesting
130 complex relationships between the CCMs and expression of individual genes. The candidate
131 CCMs were further evaluated for association with TMB and OS using Cox proportional hazards
132 and elastic net models (see Methods for details). The 15 CCMs selected in the final model were
133 subjected to further biological annotation (Supplementary Table 1).
134


7
135 Biological annotation of genes covered by the CCMs
136 The 15 CCMs in the final model were distributed across the human genome (Supplementary
137 Table 1). These CCMs were detected in <20% to >70% of the patients in the analysis
138 population (Supplementary Figure 1b-i), and no linkage disequilibrium was observed
139 (Supplementary Figure 1b-ii). Twelve of the 15 CCMs covered distinct regions, and 3
140 overlapped in a ≈290kb region on chromosome 22:20707691-20999032 (Supplementary Table
141 1 and Supplementary Figure 1c). Forty-four major genes in the Human Protein Atlas [23] were
142 mapped to these 15 CCMs, of which 29 genes (66%) were covered by >1 CCM in the final
143 model. In contrast, only 95 of the 323 genes (29%) mapping to the remaining CCMs in the
144 original set were covered by >1 CCM. Thus, the final model enriched for loci that were covered
145 by multiple CCMs, consistent with possible functional relevance. Only 1 of the genes in the
146 original 26-gene JAV-Immuno signature (CD6) [21] was present in the 367 genes mapped to the
147 original set, and it was not present in the 15 CCMs from the final model. Individual genes from
148 these 15 CCMs (Table 1) showed both positive and negative associations with JAV-Immuno
149 (Figure 1d), suggesting that host factors may either enhance or diminish anti-tumor immunity.
150
151 We evaluated potential expression of genes mapping to the 15 CCMs using the Tabula Sapiens
152 single-cell transcriptomic atlas [24], which contains single-cell sequencing data from almost
153 500,000 cells, representing over 400 cell types and 4 major cell lineages (immune, endothelial,
154 stromal, and epithelial) assessed in approximately 22 distinct anatomical locations collected
155 from multiple donors. Supplementary Figure 2 shows expression patterns by cell type for 6
156 genes mapping to chromosome 22:20707691-20999032, which was covered by 3 CCMs in the
157 final model (Supplementary Table 1). Substantial variability in gene expression across cell
158 types was observed, suggesting that cell-specific gene-regulatory machinery operates in
159 conjunction with regulation of chromatin conformation.
160


8
161 We performed a comprehensive analysis of associations between genes and cell types reported
162 in the literature and public databases using the Data4Cure knowledge graph and platform [25].
163 Genes in the JAV-Immuno signature were predominantly associated with lymphocytes,
164 including T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (Figure 2a), as previously described [21].
165 Genes covered by the selected CCMs were associated with endothelial and fibroblast cell types,
166 in addition to lymphocytes (Figure 2b). Myeloid lineages, including monocytes, neutrophils, and
167 macrophages, were associated with genes in both signatures (Figure 2a and 2b). JAV-Immuno
168 genes were predominantly associated with Gene Ontology Biological Processes related to
169 lymphocyte activation (Figure 2c) [26]; in contrast, genes mapping to the selected CCM set
170 were associated with a wide range of biological processes (Figure 2d). These findings suggest
171 that the chromatin conformations represented by the selected CCMs may exert both distal and
172 proximal effects on lymphocyte activation.
173
174 Spatial profiling
175 Spatial transcriptomic data were used to explore the topographic expression of genes
176 represented by JAV-Immuno and the selected CCMs. A procured bladder cancer specimen was
177 selected for initial evaluation due to its robust representation of immune and non-immune cell
178 types [2]. Figure 3a-i shows a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained image of the specimen
179 identifying the position of lymphoid aggregates. Spatial indexing of transcriptomic data from this
180 specimen identified 8 clusters by BayesSpace (Supplementary Figure 3a-i). Similarities in the
181 histology and distribution of predefined gene signatures (Supplementary Figure 3a-c)
182 suggested that the 8 clusters represented 4 functional regions, labeled as epithelial, stromal,
183 transitional, and lymphoid aggregates (Figure 3a-ii). Figure 3b-i depicts the spatial distribution
184 of genes characteristic of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), originally identified in patients with
185 melanoma treated with ICIs [27]. The highest overall expression of the component genes was
186 observed in the functional region labeled as lymphoid aggregates (Figure 3b-ii and -iii),


9
187 suggesting that this region could be a locus of immune activation and maturation in the tumor
188 microenvironment. Enrichment of gene expression signatures characteristic of T follicular helper
189 cells, mature B-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and dendritic cells recruitment further support the
190 lymphoid aggregate regions as a site for priming and maturation of anti-tumor lymphocytes
191 (Supplementary Figure 3c-i-v).
192
193 The spatial distribution of genes comprising the JAV-Immuno signature was strongly correlated
194 with those in the TLS signature, suggesting that JAV-Immuno is distinctly associated with TLS
195 function (Figure 3c-i-iii, Supplementary Figure 3d). To assess the potential generalizability of
196 these findings, expression of JAV-Immuno genes was evaluated in a collection of specimens
197 representing TLS from bladder, renal, and breast cancers. All 25 genes in the JAV-Immuno
198 signature were positively associated with the presence of TLS in these regions (Figure 3c-iv).
199 Overall, JAV-Immuno appears to be more closely associated with TLS than other signatures
200 associated with ICI response [2, 28-31].
201
202 The expression of 33 of the 35 major genes mapped to the 15 CCMs was assessed in the
203 bladder specimen and appeared to be distributed broadly throughout the specimen, with slightly
204 lower overall expression in the stromal region (Figure 3d-i). Hierarchical clustering of the genes
205 by distribution between the 4 annotated regions identified subsets of genes that were prominent
206 in the lymphoid aggregate and epithelial regions, as well as the stromal region (Figure 3d-ii and
207 3d-iii). Ten of the 15 selected CCMs in Supplementary Table 1 contained ≥1 gene that was
208 more highly expressed in the lymphoid aggregate region relative to the epithelial region (Figure
209 3d-ii).
210
211 As for JAV-Immuno (Figure 3b), potential generalizability of the CCM findings was assessed by
212 evaluating expression of the genes in the TLS specimen collection (Figure 3d-iv). Several


10
213 genes positively associated with JAV-Immuno (Figure 1d) and expressed in the lymphoid
214 aggregate region (Figure 3d-ii) were associated with TLS regions in the collection (Figure 3d
215 iv), including POU2F2, MBNL1, ABI3BP, VPS13C, and CPEB1. Other genes, including CMPK2,
216 RSAD2, RNF144A, and SUCNR1, were positively associated with JAV-Immuno but were
217 expressed more prominently outside the lymphoid aggregate regions (Figure 3d-ii) and were
218 not as strongly associated with TLS in the collection (Figure 3d-iv). Participation in antiviral and
219 antibacterial responses has been described for RSAD2 [32, 33] and CMPK2 [33, 34]. Reduced
220 levels of RNF144A have been associated with PD-L1 stabilization and tumorigenesis in mouse
221 bladder cancer models [35] and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer [36]. SUCNR1
222 has been linked to altered immune infiltration of tumors in ovarian cancer [37] and renal cancer
223 [38]. The adaptive immune processes represented by JAV-Immuno may thus be tuned by
224 responses to stimuli in the tumor microenvironment that are outside of the lymphoid aggregates.
225
226 Associations between POU2F2, TMB, and OS
227 Potential relationships between genes covered by the CCMs with TMB and OS with avelumab
228 plus BSC were assessed using a 3-way interaction test (Figure 4a). This analysis was done in
229 genes that were expressed in >50% of tumor samples and/or had a coefficient of variation of
230 >5% (Supplementary Figure 4). The strongest positive monogenic association was seen with
231 POU2F2, which also showed a positive association with JAV-Immuno (Figure 1d). POU2F2 is a
232 transcription factor involved in B-cell differentiation and collaboration between B-cells and T
233 cells and is expressed in multiple cell types involved in antigen presentation, including B cells
234 and monocytes (Figure 2b) [39, 40]. The presence of the corresponding CCM was associated
235 with low POU2F2 gene expression and decreased expression of POU2F2 target genes,
236 suggesting that the CCM negatively regulates POU2F2 and downstream processes, including
237 generation of mature B cells and TLS formation (Figure 4b).
238


11
239 We then explored relationships between the POU2F2 CCM, TMB, and OS in the avelumab plus
240 BSC and BSC arms. POU2F2 CCM interactions with TMB and OS were more pronounced in
241 the avelumab plus BSC arm than in the BSC arm (Table 2). The absence vs presence of the
242 POU2F2 CCM was associated with a positive effect on OS in patients treated with avelumab
243 plus BSC whose tumors displayed low TMB (less than the median value of 7.66
244 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants per megabase); median OS was 37 vs 18 months
245 (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.24-0.89]; p=0.02). These findings suggest that the effect of CCM
246 modulation on POU2F2 expression may be strongest when the treatment effect is contingent on
247 immune responses to limited tumor immunogenicity.
248
249 Discussion
250 Data from the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial are particularly valuable for investigating complex
251 biomarker interactions in advanced UC. This is because avelumab 1L maintenance was
252 associated with significant OS and PFS benefit and because avelumab was compared with BSC
253 rather than an active treatment control. Exploratory analyses of associations between immune
254 gene expression in tumor tissue, host chromatin structure, and outcomes from the JAVELIN
255 Bladder 100 trial demonstrate the potential for circulating epigenetic biomarkers to predict
256 response to ICI. In particular, systemic host chromatin structure may affect the composition of
257 the tumor microenvironment by influencing host expression of immune response genes,
258 including those affecting the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures. The interaction between
259 TMB and a CCM covering POU2F2, a master regulator transcription factor for maturation of
260 immune responses, in the avelumab plus BSC arm but not the BSC alone arm illustrates the
261 potential for host modulation of immune responses to tumor immunogenicity.
262 Such modulation may explain why tumor types with similar tumor mutation profiles might
263 respond differently to immunotherapy [41]. While the identification of epigenetic host factors
264 influencing response to ICIs adds a new level of complexity to biomarker analyses, it also


12
265 provides an opportunity for therapeutic targeting. Studies with combinations of epigenetic
266 agents and ICIs are ongoing, and measurement of chromatin biomarkers may potentially help
267 predict response [6]. Our work also underlines the great opportunity to address the challenges
268 of using single tumor-based biomarkers, such as PD-L1 or TMB, by incorporating assessment
269 of host factors.
270
271 Our findings are subject to known caveats related to exploratory post hoc analyses, including
272 the possibility of false discovery and the lack of statistical power to detect all meaningful
273 associations. As such, our results are hypothesis-generating; the clinical validity and utility of the
274 POU2F2-containing CCM and other CCMs reported in this study should be evaluated further in
275 prospective clinical studies. In addition, the generalizability and clinical utility of the spatial
276 transcriptomic observations need to be confirmed in larger datasets. However, our observations
277 support further evaluation of epigenetic and other blood-based biomarkers and substantiate the
278 hypothesis that polygenic host factors may contribute to ICI activity. This knowledge could
279 potentially help optimize the design of ICI-based treatment regimens for patients with advanced
280 UC.
281
282 Online Methods
283 Study cohort
284 JAVELIN Bladder 100 (NCT02603432) was a randomized phase 3 trial evaluating avelumab 1L
285 maintenance (administered every 2 weeks) plus BSC vs BSC alone in patients with advanced
286 UC whose cancer had not progressed after 4-6 cycles of 1L platinum-based chemotherapy [3].
287 Patients received treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
288 consent. OS (primary endpoint) and PFS (secondary endpoint) were significantly prolonged with
289 avelumab plus BSC vs BSC alone. Peripheral blood was collected from patients 4-10 weeks
290 after the date of administration of the last dose of chemotherapy but before treatment with


13
291 avelumab plus BSC or BSC alone. Blood samples from 496 patients satisfied quality and
292 consent criteria and were subjected to further evaluation, as shown in Supplementary Figure
293 1a. Characteristics and outcomes in the biomarker analysis set compared with the full analysis
294 set are shown in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5, respectively. The
295 biomarker analysis set did not differ significantly from the full analysis set.
296
297 Identification of candidate CCMs using the EpiSwitch platform
298 Preparation of 3D genomic templates. EpiSwitch 3D libraries, with chromosome conformation
299 analytes converted to sequence-based tags, were prepared from frozen whole-blood samples
300 using EpiSwitch protocols following the manufacturer's instructions for EpiSwitch Explorer Array
301 kits (Oxford BioDynamics Plc). Samples were processed on the Freedom EVO 200 robotic
302 platform (Tecan Group Ltd). Briefly, the whole-blood sample was diluted and fixed with a
303 formaldehyde-containing EpiSwitch buffer. Density cushion centrifugation was used to purify
304 intact nuclei. Following a short detergent-based step to permeabilize the nuclei, restriction
305 enzyme digestion and proximity ligation were used to generate the 3D libraries. Samples were
306 centrifuged to pellet the intact nuclei before purification with an adapted protocol from the
307 QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen) eluting in 1× TE buffer (pH 7.5). 3D libraries were
308 quantified using the Quant-iT Picogreen dsDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen) and normalized to
309 5 ng/mL prior to interrogation by PCR.
310
311 Array design. Custom microarrays were designed using the EpiSwitch pattern recognition
312 algorithm, which operates on Bayesian modeling and provides a probabilistic score for a
313 region’s involvement in long-range chromatin interactions. The algorithm was used to annotate
314 the GRCh38 human genome assembly across approximately 1.1 million sites with the potential
315 to form long-range chromosome conformations. The most probable interactions were identified
316 and filtered on probabilistic score and proximity to protein, long non-coding RNA, or microRNA


14
317 coding sequences. Predicted interactions were limited to EpiSwitch sites that were ≥10 kb and
318 <300 kb apart. Repeat masking and sequence analysis was used to ensure unique CCM
319 sequences for each interaction. The EpiSwitch Explorer Array (Agilent Technologies, Product
320 Code X-HS-AC-02) containing 60-mer oligonucleotide probes was designed to interrogate
321 potential 3D genomic interactions. In total, 964,631 experimental probes and 2,500 control
322 probes were added to a 1 × 1 comparative genomic hybridization microarray slide design. The
323 experimental probes were placed on the design in singlicate, with the controls in groups of 250.
324 The control probes consisted of 6 different EpiSwitch interactions that are generated during the
325 extraction processes and used for monitoring library quality. An additional 4 external inline
326 control probe designs were added to detect a non-human (Arabidopsis thaliana) spike in DNA
327 added during the sample labeling protocol to provide a standard curve and control for labeling.
328 The external spike DNA consists of 400-bp single-stranded DNA fragments from genomic
329 regions of Arabidopsis thaliana. Array-based comparisons were performed as described
330 previously, with the modification of only 1 sample being hybridized to each array slide in the Cy3
331 channel.
332
333 Translation of array-based 3D genomic markers to PCR readouts. Stepwise diagnostic
334 biomarker discovery process using EpiSwitch technology and data analysis EpiSwitch
335 technology platform (Oxford Biodynamics, Oxford, UK) pairs high-resolution chromosome
336 conformation capture results with regression analysis and a machine learning algorithm to
337 develop disease classifications [42-44]. To select epigenetic biomarkers, patient samples for
338 each class were screened for statistically significant differences in conditional and stable profiles
339 of genome architecture. All samples used for the nested PCR biomarker discovery were
340 processed per the manufacturer’s instructions using the proprietary EpiSwitch reagents and
341 standard protocols [45]. A PCR product was detected only if the corresponding CCM was


15
342 detected. To account for variable marker stability in assay conditions, 3 template concentrations
343 (1×, 2×, and 4×) were evaluated.
344
345 Genomic mapping. Mapping was performed using the Bedtools closest function [42] for the 3
346 closest protein-coding loci: upstream, downstream, and within the long-range chromosome
347 interaction (Gencode v33). All markers were visualized using the EpiSwitch analytical portal.
348
349 Identification of top 25 CCMs associated with tumor JAV-Immuno scores. Analyses for marker
350 prioritization were performed using libraries developed for the R Statistical Language (R version
351 4.1.2). JAV-Immuno includes the following genes: CCL5, CD2, CD244, CD247, CD3E, CD3G,
352 CD6, CD8B, CD96, CST7, EOMES, GFI1, GPR18, GRAP2, IL7R, ITK, KCNA3, KLRD1,
353 NLRC3, PRF1, PSTPIP1, SH2D1A, SIT1, THEMIS, TRAT1, and XCL2. Candidate markers
354 were identified using EpiSwitch whole-genome arrays comparing 20 patients whose tumors
355 were JAV-Immunohi (greater than the median) and 20 patients whose tumors were JAV
356 Immunolo (less than the median). The data were normalized, quality controlled, and statistically
357 analyzed using the EpiSwitch array pipeline powered by the LIMMA package. The top 150
358 EpiSwitch markers were selected based on their corrected p value (false discovery rate) and
359 directionality/interaction frequency for JAV-Immuno. Feature engineering with the selected
360 EpiSwitch CCMs was performed using the same samples used in the array discovery, with an
361 additional 20 samples each of the JAV-Immunohi and JAV-Immunolo classes. A reduced set of
362 25 CCMs was generated using the univariate EXACT test (contingency testing), binary
363 weighting and multivariant analyses, permutated glmnet, VSURF, Boruta, and varSelRF. An
364 XGBoost algorithm model was used for further refinement of the CCM list [43]. Shapley additive
365 explanations values, used to characterize the contribution of each feature in a model to the final
366 prediction and final model selection, were used to confirm marker prioritization [44].

368 Prioritization of candidate CCMs based on estimated interactions with TMB and OS
369 The starting feature set comprised 25 CCMs, each measured at 3 dilution levels for a total of 75
370 features, and was assessed in 496 patients for its association with OS.
371 Model development. In step 1, features were filtered out prior to modeling if <40 subjects were
372 included in either the present or absent categories and <15 subjects in any of the 4 subgroups
373 (avelumab present, avelumab absent, BSC present, BSC absent). This filter removed 15
374 features.
375
376 In step 2, due to high correlation among CCMs measured at multiple dilution levels, further
377 screening was performed to either select 1 dilution level per CCM or remove the CCM from
378 subsequent multivariate modeling. The screening assessed each feature in association with OS
379 using 3 nested Cox proportional hazards models. The first model assessed the feature as a
380 main effect; the second included the main effect and 2-way interaction with treatment; and the
381 third included the main effect, 2-way interactions with both treatment and TMB, and the 3-way
382 interaction among feature, treatment, and TMB. For each CCM, this resulted in 3 models for
383 each dilution level. The p values derived from the 3-way interaction, 2-way interaction, and main
384 effect terms were sequentially evaluated for each CCM. The dilution level with the lowest 3-way
385 interaction p value of <0.1 was selected. If none were <0.1, the process was repeated for the 2
386 way interaction and main effect p values. If none of these p values were <0.1, then the CCM
387 was eliminated from downstream modeling.
388
389 Finally, in step 3, the remaining 16 features were fed into an elastic net Cox proportional
390 hazards model–building procedure to select a final feature set. The elastic net [46], a
391 regularized regression method using a weighted sum of the L1 and L2 penalty terms for the
392 lasso [47] and ridge [48] regression, was used for statistical model building (R package: glmnet).
393 The hyperparameters α and λ, which control the weight applied to each of the penalty terms and


17
394 the amount of shrinkage on the coefficients, were tuned using repeated 5-fold cross-validation
395 (CV). For each round of 5-fold CV, a pair of α and λ associated with the optimal model
396 performance (C-index) was determined (Supplementary Figure 6). The same procedure was
397 iterated 1,000 times using different random data partitions to account for potential CV error. The
398 most frequently selected hyperparameter pairs were chosen as optimal and applied to the full
399 dataset to obtain the final models. All but 1 of the 16 input features were retained by this
400 process, generating the list of 15 CCMs (Supplementary Table 1).
401
402 Assessment of potential CCM gene expression
403 Public data on genes labeled using Human Genome Organization nomenclature have been
404 compiled into a knowledge graph [49] by Data4Cure (www.data4cure.com). Knowledge graph
405 associations between genes and specific biomedical entity domains (eg, cell types or pathways)
406 summarize evidence from thousands of publicly available datasets and millions of publications
407 linking biomedical entities.
408
409 Visium data processing
410 SpaceRanger 2.0.1 was used to align raw reads to the GrCh38 genome and feature count
411 generation using the Human Transcriptome probe set v2.0. Visium data resolution was
412 enhanced 6-fold by inferring pseudospots using the BayesSpace method [50]. Briefly, using the
413 BayesSpace R package Visium Space Ranger, the outs folder was processed with seed 102,
414 spatialPreprocess(sceobj, platform="Visium", n.PCs=15, n.HVGs=2000, log.normalize=T),
415 followed by spatialCluster(sceobj, q=8, d=15, platform="Visium", init.method="mclust",
416 model="t", gamma=1, nrep=10000, burn.in=100, save.chain=F), and then
417 spatialEnhance(sceobj, q=8, platform="Visium", d=15, model="t", gamma=1, jitter_prior=0.3,
418 jitter_scale=3.5, nrep=100000, burn.in=100, save.chain=F). Enhanced features and spatial


18
419 coordinates for the full expression matrix were computed using enhanceFeatures and output for
420 subsequent visualization using the Data4Cure platform [25] (www.data4cure.com).
421 For the expression signatures of each pseudospot, the Data4Cure platform was used to
422 compute the gene signature score as the mean normalized average expression value across
423 the signature genes. The spot-level signature scores were plotted heat map style using the
424 pseudospot coordinates and overlayed on the approximate corresponding region of the H&E
425 image as a background image.
426 An unmarked, blinded H&E image was annotated by a pathologist for lymphoid aggregates
427 (numbered and circled in green).

609 Figure 1. Blood chromatin markers associated with JAV-Immuno in tumor and
610 interactions between TMB, treatment, and OS.
611 A. Modulation of TMB interactions with treatment based on OS outcome by JAV-Immuno score.
612 Kaplan-Meier plots of high baseline TMB (≥median) vs low baseline TMB (<median) are shown
613 for subgroups defined by treatment (avelumab plus BSC or BSC) and baseline JAV-Immuno
614 scorehi/lo (based on median split). A Cox proportional hazards model with no adjustment for
615 baseline covariates was used. A 2-sided Wald test was used to determine p values. B.
616 Discovery of CCMs using EpiSwitch platform. i. DNA from fixed and permeabilized nuclei was
617 digested with restriction enzymes and hybridized to an oligonucleotide array designed to detect
618 sequences brought in proximity by chromatin conformation. ii. Nested PCR assays were
619 designed for 150 sequences that could potentially differentiate between patients with JAV
620 Immunohi and JAV-Immunolo tumors. iii. PCR product indicated whether a given chromatin
621 marker was present or absent. Predictive models based the presence or absence of chromatin
622 marker PCR products and built using methods such as XGBoost were used to narrow the list of
623 candidate markers to 25. C. Associations between blood chromatin markers and tumor JAV
624 Immuno levels. Univariate associations are shown between JAV-Immuno score and the status
625 of 25 markers (present vs absent) detected by PCR assay across 3 template dilution levels (1×,
626 2×, and 4×). The x-axis represents magnitude and direction of differences in mean JAV-Immuno
627 levels. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing JAV-Immuno scores between the presence and
628 absence of each marker was performed at each dilution level. The y-axis represents the log10 of
629 2-sided p values based on the test. Markers and dilutions that were selected in the final model
630 are labeled. D. Correlations between individual genes covered by selected CCM markers and
631 JAV-Immuno signature scores in tumor are plotted as Pearson coefficients with log10(p value).
632 Genes with uncorrected p≤0.001 are labeled.
633 BSC, best supportive care; CCM, chromatin conformation marker; HR, hazard ratio; NE, not
634 evaluable; OS, overall survival; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TMB, tumor mutation burden.

686 Figure 2. Cell types and functions of genes covered by the selected EpiSwitch CCM. The
687 heat maps display aggregated associations between genes (rows) and cell types (columns in A
688 and B) or functions (columns in C and D) across public data represented in the Data4Cure
689 CURIE knowledge graph. The association score summarizes data and literature evidence from
690 publicly available datasets and publications linking biomedical entities. Hierarchical clustering
691 was applied to associations to generate the heat map. Association between cell types and
692 genes in the JAV-Immuno signature (A) and the selected CCM set (B). Only genes with mean
693 scores of ≥0.1 for at least 4 cell types are included. T cells and NK cells are strongly associated
694 with JAV-Immuno, whereas genes in the selected CCMs display more diverse associations,
695 including with endothelial cells, fibroblasts, B cells, and monocytes, as well as NK and T cells.
696 Comparison of Gene Ontology biological processes associated with JAV-Immuno (C) and the
697 selected CCM set (D). JAV-Immuno displays strong connections with T-cell processes, whereas
698 selected CCM genes are associated with more diverse processes.
699 CCM, chromatin conformation marker; NK, natural killer.

818 Figure 4. Modulation of interactions between TMB and OS by POU2F2. A. Three-way
819 interactions between POU2F2 expression in tumor, TMB, and treatment on OS outcome.
820 Continuous measures of TMB and gene expression (log2 TPM) were used in the analysis.
821 Genes that were expressed in ≤50% of samples or had a coefficient of variation of ≤5 for
822 expression were excluded from the analysis. The estimated coefficients for the 3-way interaction
823 and the p value on the y-axis were calculated based on a Cox model containing the
824 gene*TMB*treatment interaction term and all the related lower-order terms. Note that POU2F2
825 showed the strongest monogenic effect. B. Presence of the blood marker encompassing
826 POU2F2 is associated with reduced expression of POU2F2, downstream target genes, and
827 gene expression signatures characteristic of TLS. OS, overall survival; TLS, tertiary lymphoid
