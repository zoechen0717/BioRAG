Most phenotype-associated genetic variants map to noncoding regulatory regions of the human genome, but their mechanisms remain elusive in most cases. We developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, to simultaneously profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of master transcription factors (TFs). We examined the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions in erythroid differentiation, although representing <0.3% of the genome, show a ~100-fold enrichment for blood cell phenotype heritability, which is substantially higher than that for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.
H
uman genetic studies have uncovered tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with complex diseases and phenotypes. With increasingly large sample sizes, the fraction of heritability explained is approaching saturation (1–4). However, genetic mapping fails to identify the mechanisms by which variants impact phenotypes, limiting biological understanding and the development of therapeutic strategies (5). Base editing can assess the effect of variants and connect them with target genes and molecular pathways implicated in human disease. Although there has been recent progress in achieving high-throughput base editing (6–10), systematic analysis of all variants of interest is not currently feasible. Another approach leverages the fact that most trait-associated variants are located in noncoding regulatory elements of the genome, where they alter transcription factor (TF) and related protein binding and thereby regulate gene expression (11–13). A powerful way to study the mechanisms influenced by genetic variation could thus be to modulate TFs and
simultaneously read out the genome-wide consequences on chromatin accessibility of cis-regulatory elements and gene expression (Fig. 1A). To assess many TFs across diverse cell states involved in physiology and disease (14, 15), such studies should be performed at single-cell resolution and in disease-relevant primary cells (16, 17). In this study, we developed Perturb-multiome to achieve this goal and apply it to study perturbations of key TFs in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which can then be differentiated to produce mature red and other blood cells. We found that the regulatory regions in erythroid differentiation whose chromatin accessibility is sensitive to perturbation of these TFs (i.e., TFsensitive regulatory regions) comprise <0.3% of all regions in the genome but are enriched by nearly 100-fold for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with certain blood cell phenotypes. Our framework can be applied to human diseases and phenotypes beyond hematopoiesis to advance the understanding of genetic variants and the mechanisms underlying inherited risk for complex diseases.
Results
Pooled TF perturbation screens to uncover coordinated chromatin accessibility and RNA alterations
Perturb-multiome applies a library of CRISPRbased perturbations to a cell population and recovers three distinct readouts from each single cell: (i) the identity of the genetic perturbation [single-guide RNA (sgRNA)]; (ii) chromatin accessibility at cis-regulatory elements
[single-cell sequencing assay for transposaseaccessible chromatin (scATAC-seq)]; and (iii) gene expression [single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)] (Fig. 1, A and B). To apply Perturb-multiome in primary cells, we designed the method to overcome challenges in gene-editing efficiency and to effectively identify a specific perturbation. To achieve high editing efficiency with minimal toxicity, we delivered pooled sgRNAs through an optimized CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) vector and electroporated recombinant Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (6, 18) [Fig. 1B; fig. S1, A to C; and materials and methods]. To optimally identify perturbations, we developed a biotinbased enrichment strategy (fig. S11, materials and methods, and supplementary text). We achieved high specificity by amplifying CROPseq transcripts containing the identity of the perturbation in each single cell by using biotinylated primers, which were then pulled down with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and further amplified for sequencing. We applied Perturb-multiome to primary human HSPCs, which can be differentiated to faithfully recapitulate hematopoietic differentiation in vitro (6, 19, 20). We perturbed 19 TFs, ranging from well-known master hematopoietic regulators to others with suggested roles in hematopoiesis (fig. S3A) (21). For each TF, we delivered three different sgRNAs targeting distinct positions in the coding sequences, along with six controls [three nontargeting sgRNAs and three sgRNAs targeting the “safe harbor locus” adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) in the genome to account for potential effects induced in cells by doublestranded DNA breaks and repair] (table S1 and materials and methods). We profiled cells across four time points. With modest sequencing depth, we detected (i) sgRNA identity in 91.1% of cells (137,604 cells); (ii) an average of 27,774 ATAC fragments and 10,803 distinct ATAC peaks per cell; and (iii) an average of 15,970 RNA molecules from 4,129 distinct genes per cell (fig. S2, A to H). Across the cell population, we detected 230,083 distinct ATAC peaks and 33,415 expressed transcripts. We focused on the process of red blood cell production, or erythropoiesis, because nearly half of blood cell trait–associated variants have associations with the erythroid lineage, and genetic variation explains a substantial portion (between 7.19 and 26.95%) of the heritability of these phenotypes (fig. S8A and materials and methods) (1, 2, 13). After a brief initial stage of multilineage differentiation to enable some differentiation to non-erythroid fates, we promoted erythroid differentiation of HSPCs. Cells were assayed at days 7, 9, 11, and 14. We recovered a wide range of cell states, from early common progenitors and non-erythroid lineages (megakaryocyte, monocyte, dendritic cell, and granulocyte precursors)

to terminal erythroid precursors that closely mimic cell states present in human bone marrow (22) (Fig. 1C; fig. S1, D to J; and materials and methods). Perturb-multiome faithfully identified various well-characterized gene regulatory mechanisms in hematopoiesis. For example, cells with perturbations in the BCL11A TF, a repressor of fetal hemoglobin and a regulator of the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch (23, 24), displayed both increased chromatin accessibility at the fetal hemoglobin promoters and increased gene expression at the fetal hemoglobin genes (HBG1 and 2), compared with controls (Fig. 1D). Similarly, cells with perturbations in GATA1 TF showed significantly higher promoter accessibility and gene expression at GATA2 (Fig. 1E), which is consistent with the negative feedback loop between GATA1 and GATA2 (25, 26). These results illustrate the ability of Perturb-multiome to obtain finegrained insights into physiologically relevant processes directly in primary human cells.
Assessment of perturbation effects and identification of TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions and genes.
As a first step in our analysis, we sought to characterize (i) the gene-editing efficiency of each sgRNA and (ii) the perturbation level actually achieved in individual cells, which can vary among cells receiving the same sgRNA. To characterize gene editing efficiency, we used pooled single-cell genotyping (fig. S3B and materials and methods) (6). We relied on genotyping rather than the mRNA level of the targeted gene, because some CRISPR-Cas9 edits that disrupt protein-coding regions do not alter mRNA levels. We analyzed 17,665 single cells in droplets, performing 55 multiplexed polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) in each cell to estimate editing efficiency. These PCRs corresponded to the human genomic sites targeted by sgRNAs, as well as 10 regions within the integrated lentiviral genome to identify the sgRNA in the cell (Fig. 2A, left, and fig. S3, C and D). Given that a simple binary classification of cells either being perturbed or not has limitations during dynamic processes such as differentiation, we defined “perturbation scores” for both the ATAC and RNA data by comparing the chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiles of the cell with those from nearestneighbor control cells, which represent a similar differentiation state (Fig. 2A, middle and
right; fig. S3F; and materials and methods) (27). The perturbation scores were well correlated with sgRNA editing efficiency (fig. S3E). The exceptions included two TFs (GATA2 and SPI1) for which we achieved strong knockdown (confirmed by protein levels) but saw low perturbation scores in erythroid lineages; these TFs have their strongest effects in nonerythroid lineages (fig. S3G) (28, 29). The accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) identified in Perturb-multiome were similar to the ACRs characterized in ex vivo bone marrow hematopoietic cells (30), suggesting that our findings are representative of gene regulation in human hematopoietic cells (fig. S3, H and I, and materials and methods). We then defined TF-sensitive ACRs and TFsensitive genes by using a linear model that incorporated the perturbation level achieved in each single cell (materials and methods). We found that roughly 21.8% of the ACRs (50,114/ 230,083) (table S2) and 26.0% of expressed genes (8,694/33,415) (table S3) were affected by at least one TF perturbation (fig. S5, A and B). Calibration analyses are included in the supplementary text. TF-sensitive and non–TFsensitive ACRs were similarly distributed across genomic features and the genome (figs. S4B and S8B). Of these TF-sensitive results, 32% of ACRs and 22% of genes responded to only a single TF perturbation (fig. S4, C, D, and F). To assess data robustness, we examined an independent biological replicate (using HSPCs from a different donor and sgRNAs targeting different locations in the coding sequences of each TF, for a subset of eight TFs) and found that the results were highly correlated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with average correlation of >0.9 for TFs targeted in both replicates (Fig. 2, B and C, and fig. S4A). GATA1sensitive genes and ACRs were in agreement with independent GATA1 loss-of-function datasets (31, 32) (fig. S7, C and D). In summary, a continuous perturbation score was used to identify TF-sensitive genes and ACRs in the heterogeneous cell populations that we studied (supplementary text).
Properties of TF-sensitive ACRs and genes
Having used Perturb-multiome to separately analyze changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we next examined the correlation between these features in single cells carrying a given sgRNA to define ACR-gene linkages (Fig. 3A and materials and methods). If an ACR regulates a gene and TF perturba
tion modulates the ACR’s accessibility, the regulated gene will change its expression. To assess ACR-gene linkages, for each cell we defined two scores: (i) the average expression of the TF-sensitive genes for a given TF and (ii) the average expression of the genes correlated with TF-sensitive ACRs. We found strong concordance between these scores (Fig. 2D; fig. S5, C and D; and materials and methods). First, we examined the effect of TF perturbation on ACR-gene pairs lying within 50 kb of one another. For pairs in which the ACR and the gene were both TF-sensitive (hereafter TFsensitive ACR-gene pairs), the correlation (at the single-cell level) was higher; this result was seen at all six erythroid TFs for which there was a substantial number of such pairs (fig. S6, A and B, and fig. S7, A and B). For example, pairs in which the ACR and gene were both GATA1-sensitive had higher correlations across single cells (Fig. 3B, top). We found that TFsensitive pairs were 10.34 times more likely among pairs in which the gene responded to enhancer perturbation [by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)] than among pairs where the gene did not show a response [odds ratio (OR) 10.34, P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test] (Fig. 3B, bottom, and materials and methods) (33). This suggests the possibility of using ACR-gene pair TF sensitivity in correlated pairs to reconstruct gene regulatory networks on a genomewide scale. Second, we considered ACR-gene pairs within 2 Mb that showed coordinated changes and examined their three-dimensional proximity, based on Hi-C data from human HSPCs (materials and methods) (34). We found that significant TF-sensitive ACR-gene pairs had higher odds of being found within topologically associated domains (TADs) in HSPCs (OR 1.53, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3C). Third, we observed that TF-sensitive genes exhibited lower RNA polymerase II pausing compared with non–TF-sensitive genes with similar expression levels (fig. S4E and materials and methods) (35). Fourth, we examined whether TF-sensitive ACRs occurred near binding sites for the perturbed TF. We analyzed published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets for two of our TFs, GATA1 and NFE2, in primary human proerythroblasts (materials and methods) (36). We found that TFsensitive ACRs in the regions surrounding GATA1 and NFE2 ChIP-seq peaks showed

stronger significance levels [i.e., higher –log10(P values)] (Fig. 3D and fig. S7, E and F). We then focused on one of the ACR-gene pairs with the highest TF sensitivity upon GATA1 perturbation. This pair, located at 5q35.2, involves the CPEB4 gene and an ACR 25 kb upstream of the gene’s transcription start site and lies within a TAD in HSPCs. Cpeb4 plays a role in mouse erythropoiesis but has not been studied in humans (37). The ACR has two variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other that are associated with multiple red blood cell traits (1, 2). We found that the most significant TF-sensitive ACRs within the TAD were strongly correlated with GATA1 ChIPseq peaks (Fig. 3E) (2). Besides having high geneACR correlation, independently, CPEB4 and the ACR each also had the most significant changes in response to GATA1 perturbation within the TAD (Fig. 3F). These observations suggest that GATA1 binds at the ACR to modulate CPEB4 expression. To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPRCas9 to delete the ACR in primary cells. The deletion resulted in decreased CPEB4 expression during erythroid differentiation (Fig. 3G and fig. S7G). Furthermore, perturbation of CPEB4—and to a lesser extent, deletion of the regulatory element—resulted in impaired terminal erythroid differentiation, which is consistent with the variant associations within the ACR with multiple erythroid traits and prior studies on the role of Cpeb4 in mouse erythropoiesis (Fig. 3H) (37). We next examined the effect of editing one of the variants with base editor TadCBE (38) (materials and methods). This single-nucleotide change reduced the expression of CPEB4 in primary erythroblasts (Fig. 3I). Together, these results illustrate how coupling readouts of TF perturbation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility in the
same single cells can identify TF-sensitive ACRgene pairs with important roles in human erythropoiesis and can help systematically pinpoint associations between phenotypes and variants discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
TF-sensitive cis-regulatory elements are massively enriched in the heritability of blood cell phenotypes
Encouraged by the CPEB4 example, we sought to examine more broadly how TF-sensitive regulatory regions were related to naturally occurring genetic variation underlying blood cell phenotypes and diseases. We began by noting that TF-sensitive ACRs are under greater constraint (lower rate of genetic variation) (39) compared with the nonaccessible genome (Fig. 4A and materials and methods). Furthermore, for several TFs, the average constraint for TF-sensitive ACRs was higher than for non–TF-sensitive ACRs. This suggested that the TF-sensitive ACRs may play key, conserved functional roles in hematopoiesis. We explored whether genetic variants associated with blood cell phenotypes were enriched in the TF-sensitive ACRs by examining how credible sets for each trait overlapped with TF-sensitive ACRs, non–TF-sensitive ACRs, and random genomic regions. We found that, averaged across traits, the proportion of regions that contained a variant in a credible set for a trait was much higher for TF-sensitive ACRs (50.59%) than for non–TF-sensitive ACRs (39.25%) and random genomic regions (22%) (Fig. 4B). When we examined the results for individual TFs and traits, we found striking differences. The highest proportion was 65.75% for TFsensitive ACRs containing variants in credible sets for basophil number (Fig. 4B, figs. S8F and S9, and materials and methods).
For each of the blood cell traits, we also examined the proportion of heritability explained by SNPs in various regions, using partitioned linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) (materials and methods). We examined four types of ACRs: (i) TF-sensitive ACRs active during erythroid differentiation, (ii) all TFsensitive ACRs, (iii) all ACRs active during erythroid differentiation, and (iv) all ACRs observed in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells (materials and methods and fig. S8C). Although TF-sensitive ACRs active during erythroid differentiation comprise <0.3% of the genome, heritability in these regions showed ~100-fold enrichment for several traits—that is, 22.25% of the heritability for erythroid traits lies in this small proportion of the genome (Fig. 4, C and D). By contrast, the ACRs active during erythroid differentiation and all TF-sensitive ACRs showed lower enrichment (up to ~46-fold and ~26-fold enrichment for certain traits, respectively) (Fig. 4, C and D). We observed similar trends for posterior probability distributions of fine-mapped variants (fig. S10). The set of all ACRs comprises much more of the genome (7.24%) and explains more of the heritability (~79%), but the enrichment is much lower (~11-fold) (Fig. 4, C and D). Notably, the TF-sensitive ACRs active during erythroid differentiation were also significantly enriched in TF binding motifs compared with all ACRs active during erythroid differentiation (fig. S8, D and E). Furthermore, we observed that credible sets of GWAS variants that lie within the TF-sensitive regions showed clear patterns of cell type–specific enrichments for their respective traits, unlike other variants (Fig. 4E and materials and methods). These results suggest a critical role for TF-sensitive ACRs and the associated variants lying within them in explaining the heritability of blood cell phenotypes.
HSPC topologically-associated domains (TADs) (34), as a function of genomic distance and TF-sensitivity status. The odds for TF-sensitive ACR-gene pairs are shown in red. The odds for randomly sampled expression and accessibility matched control ACR-gene pairs (each non–TF-sensitive, each selected among a distribution of nonsensitive elements with similar expression and accessibility levels to their TF-sensitive counterparts) are shown in blue. Each genomic distance bin has the same number of pairs as the TF-sensitive pair, and sampling was repeated 100 times to build a distribution for each genomic bin (34) (materials and methods). The bars represent 1 SD. (D) (Top) Profile plot of independent GATA1 ChIP-seq enrichment surrounding called ChIP-seq peaks from day 12 erythroid progenitors (36).

Collectively, we found that ACRs that change in response to TF perturbation are disproportionately enriched for phenotype-relevant genetic variation. More broadly, if this is true for other complex diseases and phenotypes, it suggests that systematic mapping of TF-mediated gene regulatory networks could accelerate variant-to-function mapping.
Discussion
Understanding the molecular and functional consequences of noncoding variation is essential to dissect the mechanisms underlying complex diseases and phenotypes. These insights have proven key for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, as recently achieved in the hemoglobin disorders by emerging gene therapies (11, 20, 36, 37, 39). Scalable approaches to functionalize regulatory elements and link them to large sets of candidate phenotype-associated genetic variation are critical for making progress toward these goals, especially in human tissues with complex mixtures of cells. Analysis of genome-wide TF-sensitive regions after perturbation of 19 TFs identified a tiny subset of the genome (<0.3%) highly enriched in heritability for blood cell phenotypes, relative to hematopoietic- or erythroid-specific accessible chromatin. Notably, these regions overlapped an average of 51% of credible sets for blood cell traits (ranging from 41.31 to 65.75%) and had up to a 100-fold heritability enrichment for certain cell traits. In the future, expanding perturbations to more TFs will likely uncover additional enrichments for genetic variation. Several of the TFs studied are master regulators of hematopoietic differentiation, and their perturbation results in developmental blocks (40–43). We nonetheless obtained finegrained observations of the effects of TFs at each stage by using analytical approaches that weigh comparisons by the perturbation scores of each single cell with respect to nearestneighbor control cells, thereby leveraging the asynchronous nature of hematopoietic differentiation and overcoming the variable efficiencies and effects of perturbations. The TF perturbation approach is modular and compatible with alternative strategies to modulate gene expression (44, 45). Endogenous tagging of TFs with degrons or related approaches could explore the immediate consequences of TF degradation (46–49). However, this strategy is not currently applicable to large numbers of regulators and in HSPCs isolated from human donors (50). Although we focused on single perturbations per cell, future efforts using multiplexed perturbations could be used to discern the combinatorial logic of TF regulatory control (51, 52). While this work was under review, additional studies reported distinct but related approaches to performing
pooled perturbations with multiomic readouts in cell lines (53, 54), illuminating the broad potential for these types of approaches and the possibility to expand them with additional genome perturbation tools. We focused on the study of TF-sensitive regions and likely causal variants, which allowed us to study a larger fraction of phenotyperelevant variation beyond those that directly disrupt TF-binding motifs (13). These regions will be excellent candidates for saturation mutagenesis to identify functional base pairs and pinpoint causal variants. In addition, TFsensitive networks are likely to harbor additional genes and associated regulatory elements with still-to-be-characterized critical hematopoietic functions. We envision that the identification of TFsensitive gene regulatory networks through perturbation approaches will help in prioritizing and understanding the mechanisms underlying a wide range of human diseases and phenotypes across many tissues and organs.
