irculating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the plasma of patients with cancer constitutes a potential source of tumor-derived DNA1,2. Massively parallel sequencing analysis of cfDNA samples from patients with cancer revealed that tumor-derived cfDNA (ctDNA) accounts for only a fraction of the total cfDNA, and this fraction varies according to disease burden, site and tumor biological features, including histology, vascularization, proliferation and apoptosis rates3,4. ctDNA fraction is extremely low in many early-stage and some metastatic cancers5,6, requiring methods to detect mutations at extremely low allele fractions7. Most previous studies focused on analysis of patients with advanced disease using a panel of hotspot mutations or limited genomic regions of key cancer genes sequenced at high depths8–10, a large number of genes at moderate sequencing depths11–13 or a combination of methods to define ctDNA fraction using shallow whole-genome sequencing or targeted methods followed by whole-exome analysis of samples with high ctDNA fraction6,14,15. Even when accurate cfDNA assays are utilized, cfDNA sequencing results may still be confounded by biological signals arising from somatic mosaicism16. One form of somatic mosaicism is clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which results from the accumulation
of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells that are clonally propagated to their progeny17. These somatic mutations may provide a fitness advantage to some hematopoietic stem cells and/or their descendant cells, resulting in their disproportionate expansion8,18–20, or arise through neutral drift21. CH increases with age and occurs in up to 31% of older individuals10,20,22–26, and can also be detected in cfDNA sequencing analysis27. In this context, it may confound the interpretation of cfDNA sequencing, particularly because a large proportion of the cfDNA fragments originate from hematopoietic cells28. Comparisons of somatic genetic alterations detected in cfDNA samples and their respective tumor biopsies have revealed relatively good concordance between cfDNA and tumor biopsy sequencing, particularly among patients with advanced disease6,9,15,29–32. Additional somatic variants not present in tumor biopsies, but in cfDNA only, have also been documented4; however, their nature and source (tumor derived versus other sources) have yet to be defined. Here, we report on the development of a high-intensity sequencing assay of matched cfDNA and white blood cells (WBCs) for de novo characterization of the repertoire of somatic mutations in cfDNA, without a priori knowledge of variants present in a matched

Accurate identification of tumor-derived somatic variants in plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) requires understanding of the various biological compartments contributing to the cfDNA pool. We sought to define the technical feasibility of a highintensity sequencing assay of cfDNA and matched white blood cell DNA covering a large genomic region (508 genes; 2 megabases; >60,000× raw depth) in a prospective study of 124 patients with metastatic cancer, with contemporaneous matched
tumor tissue biopsies, and 47 controls without cancer. The assay displayed high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for denovo detection of tumor-derived mutations and inference of tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, mutational signatures and sources of somatic mutations identified in cfDNA. The vast majority of cfDNA mutations (81.6% in controls and 53.2% in patients with cancer) had features consistent with clonal hematopoiesis. This cfDNA sequencing approach revealed that clonal hematopoiesis constitutes a pervasive biological phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of matched cfDNAwhite blood cell sequencing for accurate variant interpretation.

tumor biopsy. This approach, combined with sequencing of DNA samples extracted from matched tumor tissue biopsies using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized targeted sequencing assay, allowed for categorization and quantification of cfDNA variant sources.
Results
Study design and demographic information. This prospective observational study examined the technical feasibility of a high-intensity circulating cfDNA-based platform in patients with advanced untreated or progressive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), as well as in control participants without cancer (Methods). Briefly, plasma cfDNA and matched WBC genomic DNA (gDNA) from patients with MBC, NSCLC or CRPC and from controls without cancer were subjected to a targeted capture sequencing assay comprising the entire coding regions of 508 genes and intronic and/or regulatory regions of selected genes (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). In patients with cancer, tumor biopsies and matched normal WBC samples were collected within 6 weeks of plasma cfDNA samples with no intervening therapy change, and were sequenced in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified environment using the Memorial Sloan Kettering integrated mutation profiling of actionable cancer targets (MSK-IMPACT) assay—an FDAauthorized capture-based sequencing assay targeting the coding regions of 410 genes and intronic and/or regulatory regions of selected genes (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1)33,34. For the purpose of comparison with tumor biopsies, only variants mapping to the intersection of the 410 genes present in the two gene panels were considered. Of 161 potentially eligible patients with cancer (53 MBC, 53 NSCLC and 55 CRPC) enrolled between 24 September 2015 and 1 August 2016, 124 (39 with MBC, 41 with NSCLC and 44 with CRPC) were included in the concordance subset (evaluable for both tumor tissue and cfDNA analysis; Extended Data Fig. 1). The clinicopathological features of the cohort were consistent with those of a contemporary prospectively collected cohort of consecutive cases of these malignancies (Supplementary Table 2). Of the 50 control samples from individuals without cancer, three failed cfDNA sequencing, resulting in 47 evaluable samples.
De novo detection of tumor-derived cfDNA mutations. To identify the source of somatic variants found in cfDNA, sequencing was performed independently on cfDNA, WBC gDNA and the matched tumor biopsy and WBC gDNA samples from the patients with cancer (Methods and Fig. 1a). The high-intensity cfDNA sequencing approach simultaneously analyzed plasma cfDNA and WBC gDNA using a targeted assay spanning approximately 2 megabases (Mb) and utilizing unique molecular identifiers to suppress technical assay errors at a minimum raw average target depth of 60,000× (Extended Data Fig. 2). A joint variant calling of plasma cfDNA and WBC gDNA variants was performed utilizing a machine learning-based noise model (Supplementary Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Together, this resulted in an assay with the performance characteristics necessary for the detection of mutations near the molecular limits (high technical sensitivity; Fig. 1b,c), a low false positive rate (<1 error in 1 million bases sequenced; Extended Data Fig. 3c–h), high reproducibility in independent biological replicates (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 4) and a detection performance comparable to that of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR; Fig. 1f). Our high-intensity sequencing assay was found to have a per-base error rate ranging from 1 × 10–5 to
3 × 10−5 (Supplementary Methods, Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Tables 3–5), which is comparable to that of other high-fidelity cfDNA sequencing assays25,35,36.
Given these assay characteristics, we first sought to define the performance of the high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay for the detection of tumor-derived biopsy-matched somatic mutations without previous knowledge of the somatic alterations in the tumor cfDNA sequencing analysis (henceforth referred to as de novo detection). De novo detection of at least one tumor-derived mutation, as defined by MSK-IMPACT sequencing of the tumor biopsy, was observed in 104 of the 124 evaluable patients (84%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 76–90%; Fig. 2a). The detection rate in MBC samples (95%; 95% CI: 83–99%) was significantly higher than in NSCLC samples (76%; 95% CI: 60–80%; P = 0.0258) and comparable to that of CRPC samples (82%; 95% CI: 67–92%). The large genomic footprint of the assay further allowed de novo cfDNA detection of 530 of 740 mutations detected by MSK-IMPACT in tumor biopsies (72%; 95% CI: 66–75%; Fig. 2a), with similar percentages of tumor-derived mutations detected in MBC (73%; 95% CI: 67–79%), NSCLC (71%; 95% CI: 65–76%) and CRPC samples (71%; 95% CI: 63–78%). Next, we sought to define the genes targeted by de novo-detected somatic mutations in cfDNA. Our analysis of genes recurrently mutated in cfDNA, as defined by the de novo-detected somatic mutations, revealed that they consisted mostly of the same genes found to be mutated in the respective tumor samples (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5). Most importantly, this led to de novo detection of somatic mutations in cfDNA that were present in tumor biopsies but below the MSK-IMPACT assay limit of detection (subthreshold for previously established clinical variant calling cutoffs)33,37, or were neither detected in the tumor biopsy nor in WBCs (variants of unknown source (VUSOs)). Given the low false positive rates and accuracy of the assay for measuring variant allele fractions (VAFs) (Fig. 1d–f and Extended Data Fig. 4), we quantified the VAFs of somatic mutations not present in the WBCs in controls and patients with cancer. All but two of the 67 mutations (97%) detected in controls occurred at VAFs of <1% (Fig. 2c), whereas 51.1, 56.6 and 54.5% of the variants detected in MBC, NSCLC and CRPC samples, respectively, were detected at VAFs of <1%. In the vast majority of patients (88%), somatic mutations with the highest VAF (mean highest VAF: 15.10%; median highest VAF: 9.18%) were tumor matched (biopsy matched or biopsy subthreshold; Fig. 2d). Next, we investigated whether the sensitivity of the assay would vary according to the prevalence of a given mutation within the tumor biopsy. The detection rate of mutations in cfDNA was significantly correlated with their cancer cell fractions (CCFs) in the tumor biopsies (the percentage of cancer cells within a biopsy bioinformatically inferred to harbor a given mutation in a particular patient; Methods), with mutations defined as clonal being significantly more frequently detected than subclonal mutations (P = 5.33 × 10−21; Fig. 2e). Additionally, the ctDNA fraction (the fraction of tumor-derived cfDNA) in patients with metastatic cancer varied significantly according to tumor type (P = 0.0046; Fig. 2f). To assess the association between disease burden and ctDNA fraction, volumetric assessment of the disease burden was performed (Methods). We found a significant association between the estimated disease volume based on computerized tomography scans and the ctDNA fraction (Fig. 2g) in patients with both MBC (n = 34;
P = 1.03 × 10−4) and NSCLC (n = 29; P = 0.042). For patients with CRPC who had dominant bone metastases and had undergone bone scans, an assessment of the association between the automated bone scan index (aBSI; Methods) and the ctDNA fraction also revealed a significant association (n = 39; P = 0.023; Fig. 2g). Taken together, these analyses show that this cfDNA sequencing assay has high sensitivity for the detection of tumor-derived somatic mutations and identifies mutations subclonally present in tumor tissues. In contrast, VUSOs, which are detected in neither tumor biopsies nor WBCs, may derive from multiple origins but comprise

Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and mutational signatures. We performed an exploratory analysis to determine whether TMB, mutational signatures38,39 and microsatellite instability (MSI) score40 could be defined solely using cfDNA data. Analysis of TMB by MSK-IMPACT sequencing of tumor biopsies revealed six samples with a high TMB (based on the predefined >13.8 mutations Mb−1
cut-off33), including two MBC samples, three NSCLC samples and
one CRPC sample. Four of these cases were also classified as having high TMB by cfDNA (>22.7 mutations Mb−1; Methods). The remaining two samples displayed relatively low ctDNA fractions (0.2 and 8.6%) and borderline cfDNA TMB (18.2 and 20.0 mutations Mb−1, respectively). cfDNA analysis identified six additional cases with a high TMB not detected as hypermutators by MSKIMPACT analysis of the tumor biopsy (Fig. 3a; a total of ten cases henceforth referred to as hypermutated). Potential explanations for this observation include spatial tumor heterogeneity between metastatic sites, with only some sites exhibiting a hypermutator phenotype. The ten hypermutated cfDNA samples accounted for 75% of

Tumor and matched normal samples were sequenced using the MSK-IMPACT assay, while plasma and buffy coat samples from patients with cancer and from controls without cancer from the San Diego Blood Bank underwent sequencing followed by de novo assembly and mutation detection using the high-intensity targeted cfDNA assay by GRAIL, based on a bespoke joint-variant-calling pipeline. Tumor and cfDNA somatic variant detection results were unblinded for concordance analyses. UMI, unique molecular identifier. b, Analytical performance of the targeted DNA assay.

Concordant mutation detection between the two replicates (triangles indicate biopsy-matched variants; circles indicate biopsy-unmatched variants) is enriched in allele fraction above the limit of detection. f, Comparison of VAFs measured using the targeted DNA assay (y axis) and ddPCR (x axis). cfDNA extracted from five patients with cancer with canonical hotspot mutations was subjected to ddPCR. An aliquot of the same cfDNA sample was employed for the targeted DNA assays using two versions of the protocol (version 1 and version 2). One sample lacking canonical hotspot mutation in the ddPCR measurements was excluded.

The midpoints indicate the median ctDNA fraction by cancer type and the violins extend to the full range of the data. g, Distribution of ctDNA fraction estimates as a function of disease burden. For patients with MBC (n = 34) and NSCLC (n = 29), disease volume was obtained through volumetric measurements of pre-cfDNA collection computerized tomography scans. In CRPC (n = 39), the aBSI was used to estimate disease burden. The association between tertiles of disease burden for each cohort and the ctDNA fraction was estimated using a one-sided Jonckheere–Terpstra test for increasing ctDNA fraction. Triangles indicate patients from whom some distant metastases could not be measured, and the estimates for these lesions were not included in the volumetric assessment. Note that as aBSI was employed for CRPC, not all sites of metastatic disease (for example, visceral disease) were included in the disease burden in the patients with CRPC. Horizontal bars indicate median values, while the boxes show the IQR. The whiskers extend to 1.5× the IQR on either side.

the cfDNA biopsy-subthreshold mutations and VUSOs across the entire cohort (Fig. 3b), and displayed mutational signatures consistent with the modalities of genetic instability known to occur in patients with MBC, NSCLC and CRPC. All patients with hypermutated MBC (n = 5) and one of the three with hypermutated CRPC displayed the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) mutational signatures38,39 known to be acquired in the evolution of MBC and CRPC41,42. Consistent with the results of previous analysis of NSCLC43, the mutational signatures of the two patients with hypermutated NSCLC comprised the smoking-related signature and a combination of other signatures, including APOBEC, homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency and loss of function of mismatch repair (MMR; Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5f). High MSI is a biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors44. We therefore assessed the MSI status of the cohort utilizing MSIsensor40, adjusted for the ultra-high sequencing depth of cfDNA, tumor biopsy and matched normal WBCs (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). Our analysis revealed one
CRPC sample with genomics features of high MSI (Fig. 3d), which was also found to display a dominant MMR mutational signature (Fig. 3c). This patient with CRPC33 received an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor and displayed rapid and sustained tumor regression, as defined by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1) and prostate-specific antigen serological levels (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these results suggest that this cfDNA sequencing assay can accurately detect tumor-derived mutations across a large portion of the genome, potentially allowing for the characterization of TMB, MSI status and mutational signatures with resulting implications for treatment selection.
Characterization of the biological sources of cfDNA variants. Despite the specificity of the assay for somatic mutation detection, tumor-matched alterations (biopsy matched and biopsy subthreshold) accounted for only 24.4% (739/2,983 mutations) of all somatic mutations detected in the cfDNA of patients with cancer (Fig.4a).Notably,amedianof7.27 mutations Mb−1(range:0.91–20.91

mutations Mb−1) were detected in the cfDNA samples of controls without cancer (Fig. 4a). Although previous studies have suggested that these alterations probably constitute technical artifacts of ultrahigh-depth sequencing analysis45,46, based on the specificity of our assay, we posited that these variants instead stemmed from somatic mosaicism (in particular, CH) and tumor-derived events resulting from spatial genetic heterogeneity (as seen in the cases of hypermutated cancer). First, we investigated the presence of somatic mutations in the WBC sequencing results (WBC-matched mutations) for the mutations defined as somatic by cfDNA analysis but for which there was no evidence of the mutational event in the matched tumor biopsy. This analysis revealed that in control patients without cancer, the vast majority (81.6%; 297 of 364) of somatic mutations detected were also identified in WBCs, suggesting that these somatic genetic alterations were probably not technical artifacts, but rather a result of CH (Fig. 4a). Likewise, the majority (53.2%; 918/1,727) of mutations identified in cfDNA samples of patients with non-hypermutated cancer were also WBC matched (Fig. 4a). Importantly, the number of WBC-matched cfDNA variants in patients with cancer did not correlate with the number of tumor-matched mutations (biopsy matched or biopsy subthreshold), making them less likely to be of tumor origin (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6a). As CH is related to age23, we examined the association of age with the number of somatic DNA variants in the cfDNA samples from individual participants. As expected, the number of WBC-matched variants, but not the number of biopsy-matched or biopsy-subthreshold variants, significantly correlated with age (smoking-adjusted P = 3.86 × 10−27; Fig. 4c). Based on this interpretation, the cfDNA and WBC sequencing analysis performed here suggests that 89.5% of patients with cancer and 83% of controls without cancer have evidence of CH in their cfDNA (Fig. 4b). Consistent with recent observations in a population without cancer27, and with the notion that these mutations constitute CH events, the vast majority of WBC-matched somatic mutations detected in the cfDNA of patients with and without cancer involved canonical CH genes, such as DNMT3A, TET2, PPM1D and TP53 (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 6b)10, while some of these pathogenic alterations affected cancer genes other than the canonical CH genes (Supplementary Table 6). Additionally, the VAFs of WBC-matched cfDNA variants were correlated with their VAFs in the WBCs (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d), making it unlikely that they resulted from systematic sequencing errors or background noise. Previous studies of hypermutated tumors have shown significant spatial heterogeneity resulting in numerous subclonal mutations private to each tumor site47. Consistently, the overall proportion of tumor-matched mutations (biopsy matched and biopsy subthreshold) was significantly lower in the ten patients with hypermutation (17.2%; 216/1,210; non-WBC-matched mutations) than in the 114 non-hypermutated patients (30.3%; 523/1,727; P = 1.2 × 10−16), whereas a higher proportion of tumor-derived variants were subclonal biopsy-subthreshold variants in hypermutated cases (41.2% (89/216) versus 15.3% (80/523), respectively; P = 1.7 × 10−13). These findings support the notion that a single tumor biopsy may not always capture the full landscape of the tumor mutational profile in patients whose tumors harbor a hypermutator phenotype. Given the correlation between sequencing depth and occurrence of technical artifacts, we next investigated whether mutations detected in cfDNA at ultra-high sequencing depths could be attributed to residual sequencing noise. Of 215 mutations detected at a collapsed depth of >10,000×; 121 (56.3%) and 20 (9.3%) mutations were identified in two known hypermutated patients (Extended Data Fig. 7a). The variant level collapsed depth of somatic mutations was a function of the mean collapsed target coverage in cfDNA and the amount of input DNA (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Furthermore, there was no association between the VAF and the sequencing depth
of variants, irrespective of the source of origin (Extended Data Fig. 7d). These mutations were also highly replicable and could not be attributed to copy number gains or amplification of the corresponding loci (Extended Data Fig. 7e–h). Overall, these results indicate that the mutations found at high sequencing depths were unlikely to constitute sequencing artifacts. Next, we sought to define the biological source of nonsynonymous VUSOs in cfDNA (Methods). After removing variants with a known source of origin (WBC matched; biopsy matched and biopsy subthreshold in patients with cancer), approximately 31.9% of noncancer controls had no additional variants identified in cfDNA, with the remaining 68.1% harboring at least one VUSO (Fig. 4b). In patients with cancer, 77.7% (994/1,280) of the VUSOs were detected in the ten samples of hypermutated cancer. In fact, VUSOs accounted for 82.1% (994/1,210) of the total non-WBC-matched somatic cfDNA mutations in hypermutated samples, compared with 35.4% (286/809) in non-hypermutated tumors (P = 9.3 × 10−103). Additionally, VUSOs rarely constituted the mutation at the highest VAF in patients with cancer (17.6, 23.1 and 19.5% of patients with MBC, NSCLC and CRPC, respectively). These findings indicate that a large proportion of the VUSOs probably originated from the tumor and may not have been detected in the biopsy sample taken due to spatial tumor heterogeneity and sampling bias. To investigate the potential origins of the VUSOs further, we evaluated the genes harboring variants classified as such in patients with cancer (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). A subset of VUSOs affected specific genes known to harbor somatic mutations occurring late in the evolution of the respective cancer type and commonly found altered at subclonal levels in metastatic cancers, including mutations in ESR1, RB1 and NF1 in MBC, the EGFR T790M mutation in NSCLC, and AR mutations in CRPC (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 5a)37. Furthermore, the VAF distribution for these mutations mostly mirrored that of biopsy-matched variants (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). In hypermutated cases, however, a significant correlation between the size of the sequenced coding region of a gene harboring VUSOs and the number of VUSOs affecting the given gene was observed (P = 4.4 × 10−16; Extended Data Fig. 5b). To determine the accuracy of the cfDNA assay for detecting VUSOs, we performed orthogonal validation of our results utilizing ddPCR assays targeting VUSOs (Methods and Fig. 4f) and found complete agreement between the two assays. Based on these results, we posit that these VUSOs are for the most part tumor derived and stem from increased mutational rates found in cancer cells from patients with tumors displaying a hypermutator phenotype. It should be noted that, in controls, the genes most frequently harboring VUSOs also included canonical CH genes (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Consistent with the notion that at least a subset of VUSOs arise from CH or other sources of somatic mosaicism not present in matched WBC samples, VUSOs were weakly associated with age at sample collection (P = 0.141; Fig. 4c) and affected canonical CH genes in both patients with cancer and controls (Extended Data Fig. 5c–e), with some having similar allele frequencies to WBC-matched variants (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). Taken together, this high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay identified that CH mutations are the most likely origin of nontumor-derived mutations detected in cfDNA, CH is probably more prevalent than was previously reported with lower-depth WBC sequencing approaches10,20,22–24,26, and subclonal tumor-derived mutations absent in the tumor biopsy can be detected in cfDNA.
Characterization of WBC variants. High-depth sequencing analysis of WBCs currently constitutes the main approach for the detection of somatic alterations originating from CH. Here, the cfDNA assay detected 57.3% of the somatic variants with supporting reads in WBCs, which were also sequenced utilizing the same high-intensity assay (Fig. 5a and Methods). At least one CH mutation was

detected in 99.1% of the WBCs of the patients with cancer analyzed, and in 93.6% of the controls without cancer. If a patient harbored a mutation affecting a canonical CH gene, there was a high likelihood of other CH mutations being detected in the same patient, and in those with CH events, the number of mutations was significantly correlated with age (P = 6.09 × 10−64; Fig. 5b). In 41.6% of patients with metastatic cancer, the mutation found at the highest VAF affected one of the 15 canonical CH-related genes, with DNMT3A
and TET2 being the genes whose mutations were most frequently detected at the highest VAFs in both controls without cancer and patients with metastatic cancer (Fig. 5c). Consistent with previous studies suggesting that therapeutic interventions may result in the acquisition of specific types of CH events20,48, our results indicated that somatic mutations affecting PPM1D were significantly more frequently detected in patients with cancer than in controls (age-adjusted P = 0.0115; Fig. 5c).

In addition, mutations affecting PPM1D—in particular truncating variants preferentially affecting the carboxy-terminal domain (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 8)—were significantly more common in patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy than in those who had no previous history of such treatments (age- and smoking-adjusted P = 0.0008; Fig. 5c).
Gene copy number variation (CNV) detection. As an exploratory analysis, we sought to define whether the high-intensity cfDNA assay would be able to detect CNVs de novo. We observed a relatively good concordance between CNVs detected in tumor biopsies and cfDNA only in cases where the ctDNA fractions were ≥10% (Extended Data Fig. 9). Despite this limitation, in five patients with actionable CNVs (four patients with MBC and amplified ERBB2, and one patient with NSCL and amplified MET), three of the ERBB2 amplifications could be detected de novo. In the two cases where actionable CNVs were present in the MSK-IMPACT tumor biopsy but not in cfDNA, the ctDNA fractions were 1.3 and 1.9% (Extended Data Fig. 10). None of the remaining samples tested harbored amplifications of these two genes, thereby showing the specificity. However, the performance of the cfDNA assay to detect gene amplifications was found to be highly dependent on the ctDNA fraction.
Discussion
Most clinical cfDNA assays in current use target a small panel of genes or hotspot mutations in key cancer genes, and do not incorporate matched WBC sequencing. Previous attempts to broaden the genomic area probed by cfDNA sequencing assays resulted in the identification of not only mutations known to be present in tumors but also a large number of variants absent in the respective tumor tissues and inferred to be somatic. Despite the use of multiple strategies to mitigate sequencing artifacts, it has been postulated that high-depth sequencing assays covering a large genomic region would inevitably result in the identification of a high number of false positive sequencing variants45,46. Here, we devised a high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay covering a large genomic region based on a joint analysis of cfDNA and WBC gDNA, utilizing unique molecular identifiers to suppress technical assay errors and hierarchical Bayesian error correction models to mitigate mutation detection artifacts stemming from ultra-high sequencing depths. Our findings highlight the importance of having methods to mitigate sequencing errors coupled with matched WBC sequencing performed at similar depths to those employed for the cfDNA analysis. Without taking into account the results of WBC sequencing, cfDNA sequencing (often currently performed in the clinical setting) might be misleading, given that some CH mutations affecting cancer genes may be interpreted as tumor-derived mutations (for example, TP53 mutations). The high-intensity cfDNA sequencing approach allowed for robust de novo detection of somatic mutations with a sensitivity similar to that of ddPCR (Fig. 1f) and was comparable to previous high-depth targeted sequencing efforts49–51, allowing for the detection in cfDNA of 77.4% of the repertoire of somatic mutations reported in the matched tumor biopsy samples from patients with advanced cancers. Given the large genomic footprint and the limited number of false positive variants (Fig. 1d,e), this cfDNA assay also allowed for the de novo assessment of TMB and mutational signatures, including MSI (Fig. 3a–e), in patients with advanced cancers. Our analyses revealed that the majority of non-tumor-matched nonsynonymous somatic mutations identified in cfDNA had supporting reads present in the respective WBC gDNA samples, which were present in the vast majority of patients with and without cancer. These WBC-matched mutations preferentially affected genes previously implicated in CH10,20,22–24,26, and their presence was strongly associated with age at collection of the blood sample.
The number of these probable CH variants per patient was, on average, higher than the number of tumor-matched variants in patients with metastatic disease. The higher prevalence of CH found in WBCs in this study (93.6% of controls without cancer and 99.1% of patients with cancer) relative to that reported in previous studies10,20,22–24,26 probably resulted from the high sensitivity of the assay employed to detect variants in the WBC samples52,53, and was consistent with the observation by Liu et al.27 in a non-cancer population. In our study, however, both cfDNA and WBC samples were ultra-deep sequenced at comparable raw depths, allowing for the distinction between CH and tumor-derived mutations. Although the genes recurrently affected by these somatic genetic alterations were genes previously implicated in CH, the majority of the WBC-matched variants were private to individual patients, suggesting that accounting for them in cfDNA-based clinical assays requires the sequencing of cfDNA and matched WBC DNA in a patient-specific manner. Indeed, recent studies25,28,54 have shown in a limited number of patients that a large proportion of somatic variants in WBCs can also be identified in cfDNA, resulting in the detection of ‘false positive’ tumor-derived mutations in cfDNA. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the inconsistent results between cfDNA and tumor tissue assays, which may be due to a subset of non-tumor-origin (for example, CH) cfDNA variants being interpreted as tumor derived25,28,54, and support the need for joint analysis of cfDNA and matched WBCs, given that mutations related to CH may result in inaccurate TMB and mutational signature quantification7,28. We also demonstrated that VUSOs could have multiple origins, including tumor heterogeneity, CH occurring at extremely low levels, other sources of somatic mosaicism or a small amount of residual technical noise. The majority of the observed VUSOs were found to be tumor derived and arose from minor tumor subclones, and 77.7% of all VUSOs in patients with cancer were identified in ten patients whose tumors harbored hypermutator mutational processes, such as APOBEC, known to amplify tumor heterogeneity and subclonal diversity. Hence, in this context, high-intensity cfDNA assays may offer a more comprehensive landscape of the tumor mutational profile than tumor tissue sequencing alone. This study has several limitations. Colorectal carcinomas (another common form of cancer) were not included in this study; however, a recent study has shown the importance of cfDNA sequencing in defining the heterogeneity and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in advanced colorectal cancers15. The tumor assessment was limited to the analysis of a single tumor biopsy due to limitations in obtaining multiregional biopsies in the clinical setting. As such, the full scope of tumor heterogeneity may not have been entirely captured9. However, this caveat would remain regardless of the number of sites biopsied. Non-cancer controls were from a different source and were processed in different batches from the tumor samples, potentially affecting the results. Given that the number of samples in each tumor subgroup was relatively small, the analysis performed here may not have captured the full clinical or genomic diversity of MBC, NSCLC and CRPC and their respective subtypes. Additionally, <50 baseline samples from healthy controls were employed to train the hierarchical Bayesian model, which might be further improved through the analysis of additional samples from healthy donors followed longitudinally. Our findings also emphasize the importance of high-depth WBC sequencing, but even when this approach is employed, a subset of VUSOs might still originate from CH not detected in the matched WBC sample, other sources of somatic mosaicism, benign neoplasms and/or other forms of occult cancers not detected in the extensive clinical workup performed on the patients included in this study. Finally, the cost of this high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay may preclude its broader adoption in the clinical context at present. Despite these limitations, the high-intensity cfDNA sequencing assay described here represents an advancement in the development

Methods
Study design. This was a prospective observational study of patients with MBC, NSCLC and CRPC designed to characterize the detection of variants in plasma cfDNA using a targeted DNA assay (GRAIL), and to evaluate the concordance of variant detection between tissue and plasma as evidence of ctDNA detection. The primary objectives were to assess the tumor cfDNA detection rate based on observing at least one variant (single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or indels) and to assess the concordance of the MSK-IMPACT variants33,34 detected in tumor biopsy samples versus cfDNA. Secondary objectives included assessing the ctDNA detection rate based on observing at least one MSK-IMPACT variant, characterizing the ctDNA detection rate as a function of the type of variant (SNVs or indels) and number of variants detected, and characterizing the proportion of patients with variants detected.
Patient enrollment. All patients provided written informed consent for tumor, cfDNA and WBC sequencing, and the review of patient medical records for detailed demographic, pathological and treatment information under an Institutional Review Board-approved biospecimen umbrella protocol (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) protocol 12-245; ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01775072). At least 50 patients with each type of cancer were enrolled to obtain evaluable patients with both the targeted DNA assay and MSK-IMPACT analysis. Clinical data (baseline demographics, cancer history and previous lines of therapy) were collected from medical records. Patients with MBC, NSCLC or CRPC, with disease progression as assessed by the investigator, were eligible. Disease progression was based on objective radiographic and/or physical exam and/or biomarker results. Patients diagnosed with de novo or recurrent stage IV NSCLC or MBC were allowed to be included if enrolled before initiation of the first line of treatment for metastatic disease. No new therapies were permitted to be initiated between tissue biopsy and blood draw. Patients with progressive disease on stable doses of treatment (for example, hormone therapy) were eligible. Blood was drawn within 6 weeks of tissue biopsy for MSK-IMPACT analysis either before or after tissue biopsy. Whole-blood samples received outside of the stability timeframe for Streck DNA BCT (5 d) were excluded. Fifty de-identified whole-blood samples from self-reported healthy individuals (with no diagnosis of cancer) were obtained from the San Diego Blood Bank. Limited clinical data were provided with the samples. Healthy participants were required to be at least 20 years of age, to be eligible for blood donation per standardized assessment and criteria, to lack a diagnosis of cancer and to have no previous history of cancer. Participants were excluded if they had a previous history of cigarette smoking for at least 1 year, a current history of cigarette smoking, were pregnant, had a personal history of cancer or had previous medical or surgical treatment of any type of cancer. The results were not returned to any patients, health care providers or the San Diego Blood Bank.
Tumor sample accessioning, processing and analysis. For the 161 patients with cancer, tumor DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy samples, and matched normal DNA was extracted from mononuclear cells from peripheral blood. All specimens underwent next-generation sequencing in the MSKCC Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory using MSK-IMPACT—an FDA-authorized hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay—which analyzes all protein-coding exons of 410 cancerassociated genes (Supplementary Table 1), as previously described33,34. Average sequencing coverage across all tumors was greater than 900×. Somatic mutations, DNA copy number alterations and structural rearrangements were identified as previously described34, and all mutations were manually reviewed. After excluding samples with insufficient tumor tissue, with insufficient data quality due to low total DNA quantity and purity, or that failed library preparation, a total of 124 patients had complete MSK-IMPACT results (Extended Data Fig. 1). In addition to the gene-level amplification and deletion calls generated by the MSKCC Diagnostic Molecular Pathology pipeline, genome-wide total and allele-specific DNA copy numbers were determined using the fraction and allelespecific copy number estimates from tumor sequencing (FACETS) algorithm55 for prospectively sequenced patients. Purity, average ploidy and allele-specific integer copy number for each segment were then determined by maximum likelihood. To determine the clonality of each mutation, we used allele-specific copy number inference from FACETS to calculate the CCF, as previously described56. Clonal mutations were those with a CCF (assuming the number of mutant copies was equal to the number of copies of the more frequent allele) of >0.8 or with an upper bound of the CCF confidence interval of >0.85. Mutations with CCFs not meeting these conditions were defined as subclonal.
Whole-blood sample collection, accessioning and preparation. Peripheral blood from patients with metastatic cancer was collected into two 10-ml Cell-Free DNA BCTs (Streck) at MSKCC and shipped to GRAIL at room temperature. Whole blood from healthy individuals drawn into Streck BCTs were purchased from the San Diego Blood Bank and shipped to GRAIL at room temperature. Received whole-blood Streck BCTs were separated into plasma and buffy coat and stored at −80 °C unless processed the same day.
cfDNA was extracted from two tubes of plasma (up to a combined volume of 8 ml) per subject using a modified QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen). Extracted cfDNA was quantified using the Fragment Analyzer High Sensitivity NGS kit (Advanced Analytical Technologies). gDNA from matching buffy coat (paired plasma and buffy coat from the same blood tube) was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy Blood and Tissue kit. Extracted gDNA was quantified using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and fragmented to a mean size of 180 base pairs using the Covaris E220 ultrasonicator. Sheared gDNA was subsequently size selected using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), then quantified using the Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS kit (Advanced Analytical Technologies).
Library preparation, target enrichment and sequencing. Buffy coat gDNA (50 ng) and plasma cfDNA (≤75 ng) were used for next-generation sequencing library construction with a modified Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano protocol. Details are available in the Supplementary Methods.
Analysis pipeline. A modular analysis pipeline was implemented to enable detection of mutations at very low allele fraction by suppressing noise caused by assay and alignment processes. The details of this pipeline are provided in the Supplementary Methods. In brief, this methodology consisted of: (1) preprocessing and a first-pass alignment; (2) collapsing and read-pair stitching; (3) candidate variant generation by de novo assembly; (4) edge effect scoring; (5) candidate variant analysis with recalibrated quality scores based on a hierarchical Bayesian model; and (6) joint variant analysis using the machine learning error model (Supplementary Methods), which was critical in accounting for CH of indeterminate potential and other artifacts.
Source of origin of plasma variants. Variants reported by de novo assembly from control and cancer samples were stacked, and their sources of origin were labeled through a hierarchical schema. First, variants with low read coverage (<200), high frequency of recurrence in WBCs, failed edge-variant filter or below the noise model threshold were labeled as noise. Second, variants with an allele fraction of >20% matched in WBCs were labeled as potentially germline. Third, synonymous variants were labeled as an independent category. Fourth, variants present in WBCs identified by joint calling or leaking through joint calling but failing additional thresholds were labeled as WBC matched. The additional threshold filtered variants on smoothed cfDNA allele ratio and matching WBC alternative allele depth variation. Variants unable to be joint called as separable from WBCs were labeled ambiguous (no positive evidence for variant alleles in WBCs, but insufficient depth of sequencing to prove allele frequency was statistically different in cfDNA and WBC results). The remaining variants were labeled as somatic. Somatic variants also present in the MSK-IMPACT sequencing of the tumor biopsy were labeled as biopsy matched if they had been reported, or biopsy subthreshold if they were below the limit for variant calling as required for clinical reporting. Variants not matched were labeled as VUSOs.
Tumor concordance. Overall agreement between variants in plasma and tumor tissue was measured using positive percent agreement with tumor tissue as the reference; this can be expressed as the percentage of tissue variants also detected in plasma. The top mutated cancer genes were generated by merging the top 15 genes reported by MSK-IMPACT analysis from each cancer cohort. Somatic variants (VUSOs, biopsy matched and biopsy subthreshold) from the top mutated cancer genes were selected from plasma variants for plotting and comparison.
Disease burden and ctDNA fraction. The ctDNA fraction for each plasma sample was estimated from clonal biopsy-matched mutations. Briefly, we first obtained the CCF estimate of somatic mutations detected in the matched tumor biopsy sample using the FACETS algorithm, as previously described55, and then we derived the ctDNA fraction based on the VAF in cfDNA of the biopsy-matched clonal mutations. Of the 80 patients in the NSCLC and MBC cohorts, 77 had computerized tomography scans available from which volumetric tumor measurements could be obtained. Of these, 34 of the exams were computerized tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast, obtained as part of a positron emission tomography/computerized tomography exam; 32 exams were computerized tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast; five exams were computerized tomography scans of the chest only with intravenous contrast; four exams were computerized tomography scans of the chest only without intravenous contrast; and two exams were computerized tomography scans of the chest and abdomen with intravenous contrast. Exams were acquired on several different scanners at slice thicknesses ranging from 3.75–5.00 mm. All exams were reviewed by a board-certified radiologist specializing in imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (K.J.). All metastatic lesions >1 cm in diameter were identified. Volumes were measured on all lesions except bone lesions. Bone lesions often have poorly defined borders and active metastases are difficult to distinguish from treated disease. Volumes were measured using the Aquarius iNtuition advanced visualization software (version 4.4.13.P3; TeraReco).

Of the 77 patients with available volumetric assessment, 34 with MBC and 29 with NSCLC had evaluable ctDNA fraction and were included in this analysis. Given that the majority of patients with CRPC included in this study had extensive bone disease and had undergone bone scans before enrollment in the study, the approach employed for the volumetric assessment of disease burden was different from that used for patients with MBC and NSCLC. For patients with prostate cancer, we generated the aBSI (platform version 3.3; EXINI Diagnostics)—a fully quantitative assessment of a patient’s bony disease on a bone scan that reports the number of lesions, area and fraction of the total skeleton weight that is involved by tumor, as a proxy for bone disease burden. The methodology of the automated platform has been described in previous studies57. In brief, a neural network automatically segments the different anatomical regions of the skeleton, followed by detection and classification of the abnormal hotspots. The weight fraction of the skeleton for each metastatic hotspot was calculated, and the aBSI was calculated as the sum of all such fractions. The aBSI method utilized in this study has been shown to be an objective measure of the quantitative change in disease burden bone scans and a prognostic biomarker in patients with CRPC58.
Mutation burden and association with age at diagnosis. Mutation burden was calculated as the number of nonsynonymous mutations per megabase pair of genome sequenced. The relationship of mutation burden with age and cancer status was examined by fitting a zero-inflated Poisson regression, with the cancer status and smoking history as covariates. To assess the age relationship with variant source, the analysis above was stratified by variant source of origin.
Mutational signatures from hypermutated patients. The threshold of mutation burden used to define hypermutated patients was defined as 13.8 mutations Mb−1 (ref. 33) for the tumor biopsy, while the corresponding value for cfDNA was evaluated de novo from the samples of patients with cancer as the median cfDNA mutation burden + 2 × the interquartile range (IQR) of the cfDNA mutation burden. The contributions of different mutation signatures were identified for each sample according to the distribution of the six substitution classes (C > A, C > G, C > T, T > A, T > C and T > G) and the bases immediately 5′ and 3′ of the
mutated base, producing 96 possible mutation subtypes using deconstructSigs59. For the analyses described here, we focused on six signatures: (1) aging (signatures 1 and 5); (2) APOBEC (signatures 2 and 13); (3) homologous recombination repair deficiency (homologous recombination DNA repair deficiency; signature 3); (4) MMR (signatures 6, 15, 20 and 26); (5) smoking (signature 4); and (6) POLE (signature 10).
Prevalence of CH in cfDNA. WBC-matched variant occurrence was measured at the gene level using the ratio between the number of variants in a gene versus the total number of variants. The cumulative frequency was generated by first ranking the ratio by descending order and then recursively adding the ratio together. Top mutated genes carrying WBC-matched variants were visualized by a heatmap. The top 20 genes were selected from each cohort and merged to form the final list of top genes. The number of patients carrying WBC-matched variants in each gene was used to measure the gene occurrence.
Prevalence of CH in WBCs. Candidate variants in WBCs were generated by de novo assembly of error-corrected and stitched read pairs, and post-filtered as follows: (1) following quality score recalibration, variants with low quality (<60) or low depth (<500×), as well as bona fide somatic variants found in the corresponding tumor biopsy, were excluded from downstream analyses; (2) technical artifacts occurring at identical genomic coordinates and representing identical reference and alternate alleles recurring at >5% were filtered out to avoid possible technical artifacts unless: they had previously been reported as somatic in COSMIC (version 86), Kandoth et al.60 or Chang et al.61; or they were frameshifting indels or truncating SNVs and occurred in one of 15 canonical genes known to be associated with CH; (3) variants with VAF > 30% were labeled germline and filtered out unless they were frameshifting indels or truncating SNVs and occurred in one of the 15 canonical CH genes; (4) variants occurring at any allele frequency in the Exome Aggregation Consortium or Genome Aggregation Database62 were labeled germline and filtered out; (5) variants mapping to the HLA-A locus were excluded; and (6) only nonsynonymous exonic variants passing the above filters were considered further. The highest variant-level recurrences occurred in DNMT3A, TET2, PPM1D and TP53 at <5% recurrence (Extended Data Fig. 7), consistent with the joint variant calling of plasma cfDNA, where the top mutated genes harboring WBC-matched variants were identical (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 6). The 15 canonical genes known to be associated with CH were DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, PPM1D, TP53, JAK2, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, IDH1, IDH2, U2AF1, CBL, ATM and CHEK2.
Summary of variants and VAFs in cfDNA. The mean and median number of
each type of identified variant in the samples, as well as the mean and median VAF in the samples, are described in Supplementary Table 7. In cfDNA samples, more WBC-matched variants than biopsy-matched variants or VUSOs were identified. The median VAF in cfDNA was higher for biopsy-matched variants than for WBCmatched variants or VUSOs.
Sensitivity and specificity of the targeted DNA assay. Before analysis of patient samples with the targeted DNA assay, analytical characterization was performed using titrations of DNA from cell lines. gDNA extracted from Epstein–Barr virusimmortalized lymphoblastoid cell line NA12878 was purchased from the Coriell Institute. The HD753 Structural Multiplex Reference Standard gDNA, which contains known SNVs, indels, fusions and deletions, was purchased from Horizon Discovery (Supplementary Table 8). Fifteen DNA titrations using the HD753 standard and the NA12878 gDNA were prepared in triplicate to have nominal expected VAFs of 0, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00% for a majority of variants. The gDNA titrations were verified using ddPCR (Bio-Rad) to ensure dilution accuracy (Supplementary Table 9). Following ddPCR verification, DNA mixtures were sheared and size selected according to the targeted DNA assay protocol. A total of 30 ng sheared, size-selected gDNA was used for library construction, resulting in a mean collapsed target coverage of 2,430×. Figure 1b shows the estimated sensitivity of the targeted DNA assay at various VAFs, using a probit regression model of variant calling status of 14 known small variants in all HD753 gDNA titrations. Each half FASTQ of one replicate was also combined into the other two FASTQs of replicates in the same titration to create three additional FASTQs (that is, if the triplicates were labeled A, B and C, the three simulated samples were AB = 0.5A + 0.5B, AC = 0.5A + 0.5C and BC = 0.5B + 0.5C), simulating higher input sample cases. The mean collapsed target coverage of simulated samples (n = 10) at the FASTQ level was 4,577×, which is similar to the median of mean collapsed target coverages for all samples from patients with cancer reported here (4,408×). The estimated 95% limit of detection was 0.36% for 30 ng of input DNA (mean collapsed target coverage of 2,430×), and for simulated cases it was 0.16% (mean collapsed target coverage of 4,577×). Figure 1c summarizes the specificity of the targeted DNA assay using samples from controls without cancer (n = 47). After de novo variant calling and WBC variant filtering, the mean number of called variants was 120.8, corresponding to a specificity of 99.9891%. After the machine learning-based joint variant calling and filtering, the mean number of called variants was reduced to 2.3, corresponding to a specificity of 99.9998%. While this drastically improved the specificity, the decrease of variant calling sensitivity was marginal. Using the same variant calling settings, the estimated sensitivities using the HD753 titrations were comparable between de novo variant calling and joint variant calling.
Reproducibility of the targeted DNA assay. The high-intensity sequencing assay was validated using two distinct approaches, namely: (1) repeated sequencing of the same sample using two versions of the assay (version 1 and version 2); and (2) ddPCR analysis of biopsy-matched mutations and VUSOs (Supplementary Methods, Fig. 1d–f, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 8–10).
MSI detection in high-depth-of-read cfDNA assays. A modified version of MSIsensor40, as described in the Supplementary Methods, was employed. Using the distributions obtained from MSIsensor and applying updated parameters and filters, more robust results were obtained in both tumor-normal utilizing MSKIMPACT and the higher-depth-of-read cfDNA/WBC samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results suggest that the high-depth-of-read cfDNA data generated in this study are suitable for detecting MSI in cancer, and that MSI detection can be further improved for shallow sequencing biopsies.
Statistical analyses. The association of VAFs between technical replicates was measured using the coefficient of determination (R2) value obtained from a linear regression. The difference in detection rate between the three cohorts was assessed using two-by-two Fisher’s exact tests, and the resulting P values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The association between the tumor mutation CCF and the cfDNA detection rate (overall and stratified by cancer type) was assessed using a χ2 trend test (Cochran–Armitage test for trend). Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the detection rate by cancer type. The difference in ctDNA fraction estimate between cancer types was assessed using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis H-test. The increase in ctDNA fraction estimate with increasing disease burden was assessed using a one-sided Jonckheere–Terpstra test and stratified by cancer type. We used zero-inflated Poisson regressions to assess the association between the number of cfDNA variants per subject from each biological source (that is, biopsy matched, biopsy subthreshold, WBC matched and VUSOs) and age, with cancer status and smoking history as covariates where appropriate. The corresponding P values were obtained using two-sided Wald tests on the coefficients of the count model. Similarly, the association between the number of CH-derived variants per subject through direct analysis of WBCs and age was assessed using a zero-inflated Poisson regression with cancer status as the covariate, and the corresponding P value was obtained using a two-sided Wald test on the coefficient of the count model. The association of CH measured in WBCs in each of the 15 canonical CH genes and cancer status and previous history of radioor chemotherapy was assessed using a permutation-based likelihood ratio test from the coefficients of a logistic regression, with age and smoking history as covariates where appropriate. Comparisons of the uncollapsed mean coverage between cfDNA and WBCs were performed using two-sided paired Mann–Whitney U-tests stratified by cohort.

cancer were performed using two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests and adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. The association of input DNA for library preparation and mean collapsed coverage of cfDNA samples was assessed using the R2 value obtained from a linear regression. The corresponding P value was obtained using a two-sided t-test. The pairwise differences of input DNA for library preparation between the different cancer cohorts and controls without cancer were assessed using two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests and adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. Pairwise comparisons of the percentage of collapsed bases with SNVs or combined SNVs and indels of cfDNA or WBCs between the different cancer cohorts and controls without cancer were performed using two-sided Mann–Whitney U-tests and adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. The association of ctDNA fraction estimate or tumor purity and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient measuring the association in log2[ratio space] between patient-matched cfDNA and tumor biopsy samples was assessed using one-sided Jonckheere–Terpstra tests for increasing ctDNA fraction or tumor purity with increasing Pearson’s correlation. Pairwise comparisons of areas under the curve for amplifications or homozygous deletions between the different cancer cohorts were carried out using two-sided DeLong tests. For each cfDNA variant category, a two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test was used to test whether the cancer cohort stratified by cancer type had a different mutation burden than the controls without cancer. All statistical hypothesis tests were considered positive at α = 0.05 and carried out in R/Bioconductor unless otherwise stated.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Hierarchical Bayesian model for calibrated analysis of somatic cfDNA variants and performance assessment. (a,b) Plate models showing the hierarchy of statistical relationships for (a) single nucleotide variants and (b) small insertions and deletions influencing the observed quantity of alternate alleles ynp in each sample n at each position p conditional on both latent parameters μ (the rate of events), θ (the type of event), α, β as well as fixed covariates xp (of X types) such as trinucleotide context and, separately, depth of sequencing at a position (dp). Note that insertions and deletions have additional complexity as one must account for length of the insertion/deletion event in the model as insertions and deletions of differing lengths have differing probabilities. The model was fitted to the training data consisting of n=43 unrelated non-cancer controls, estimates for the parameters were fixed and applied to new samples for scoring. (c,d) The posterior distributions of site-specific λp (μp dp) were summarized by their mean μp and displayed for a subset of representative sites in (c) by type of mutation and (d) by trinucleotide context. In both panels, the midpoint indicates the mean and the vertical bars represent the 95% Gaussian confidence limits based on the t-distribution. (e) Estimated μp against the observed λp for samples in the training set. Note the data points at the bottom are all positions p with non-zero mean posterior μp and zero observed alternate allele counts. (f) Comparison of the estimated probability of observing an event (x-axis) with the actual empirical probability of observing such an event (y-axis). The plot was calibrated based on estimates of μp on chromosome 21. Note the initial sharp rise reflects the number of sites with zero observed alternate allele counts whilst the excess low probability events at the other end reflects the difficulty of stringently filtering out rare biological events such as clonal hematopoiesis. (g) Mean number of variants detected in healthy control individuals (x-axis) against the recall rate of biopsy-matched variants (y-axis) for the different cancer types. At Q60, one can expect one false positive per million bases. Here, to exclude potentially CH derived variants, a fixed threshold of 0.8 on the posterior probability of detected variants originating from cfDNA (i.e. PGTKXGDNA) was adopted. (h) Mean number of variants detected in healthy control individuals (x-axis) against the recall rate of biopsy-matched variants (y-axis) at different probabilities for allowing variants to be assigned to cfDNA. The thresholds displayed were obtained by cross-validation holding out each cancer type and selecting a threshold which retains most of the biopsy-matched variants whilst still filtering out variants of potential hematopoietic origin. Here, to exclude variants potentially due to noise, a fixed threshold of Q60 was adopted.

These are labelled Replicate 1 and Replicate 2. A subset of three samples were further retested using version V2 and labelled Replicate 3. The panels illustrate the pairwise comparisons of measured VAF between all available replicates for each patient. In all panels, the variants are shape coded based on their origin, whether they were also detected in the matched tumor biopsy and color coded according to their category, whether they were detected in both replicates and whether they were assigned to similar source categories (i.e. VUSO, WBC-matched or noise). In all panels, the samples are labelled on top.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Somatic mutations occurring at high sequencing depth in cfDNA. Somatic mutations detected at sequencing depth >10,000 in cfDNA occur mostly in hypermutated samples and are related to sample level mean target collapsed depth which is itself a function of the amount of input DNA used for library preparation. (a) Number of somatic mutations occurring at >10,000 sequence depth (n=215) per patient and categorized into WBC-matched, VUSO or Tumor-matched where the latter category is composed of Biopsy-matched and Biopsy-subthreshold mutations.

(c) Variant level collapsed depth for all somatic mutations detected in cfDNA against sample level mean collapsed target depth. (d) variant level collapsed depth for all somatic mutations against modeled VAF in cfDNA. 121 of 215 (56.3%) somatic mutations detected at sequencing depth >10,000 in cfDNA occurred in the hypermutated patient MSK-VB-0023. (e, f) Log2 ratios of (e) tumor biopsy and (f) cfDNA of patient MSK-VB-0023. The tumor biopsy and cfDNA showed similar copy number alterations (i.e. 1q+ and 16q-). No high-level copy number amplifications were observed in either the tumor biopsy or the cfDNA which could explain the high sequencing depth. Three replicate sequencing of cfDNA and WBC were available for that patient. (g) and (h) Pairwise comparisons of VAF for the 121 mutations detected at depth >10,000 using version V1 of the assay. In (a), ‘1’ denotes hypermutated samples. In (b), the midpoint indicates the median whilst the violins extent to the full range of the data. In (b–d), the sequencing depths of somatic variants for the cohort of n=124 cancer patients are shown.

Data collection Tumor Tissue sequencing: Tumor sequencing was performed utilizing the FDA-authorized MSK-IMPACT assay (Zehir et al, Nat Med 2017). Briefly, tumor DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy samples and matched normal DNA was extracted from mononuclear cells from peripheral blood. All specimens underwent next-generation sequencing in the MSKCC CLIA-certified laboratory using MSK-IMPACT, an FDA-authorized hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing assay, which analyzes all protein-coding exons of 410 cancerassociated genes , as previously described (Zehir et al, Nat Med 2017, Cheng et al, J Mol Diagn 2015). Average sequencing coverage across all tumors was greater than 900X. Somatic mutations, DNA copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements were identified as previously described (Cheng et al, J Mol Diagn 2015) and all mutations were manually reviewed.
cfDNA sequencing: Whole blood sample collection, accessioning, and preparation: Peripheral blood from patients with metastatic cancer was collected into two 10 mL Cell-Free DNA BCT (Streck; La Vista, NE) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) and shipped to GRAIL, Inc. (Menlo Park, CA) at room temperature. Whole blood from healthy individuals drawn into Streck BCTs were purchased from the San Diego Blood Bank (San Diego, CA) and shipped to GRAIL, Inc. at room temperature. Received whole blood Streck BCTs were separated into plasma and buffy coat and stored at -80°C unless processed the same day.
cfDNA was extracted from two tubes of plasma (up to a combined volume of 8 ml) per subject using a modified QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD). Extracted cfDNA was quantified using the Fragment Analyzer High Sensitivity NGS kit (Advanced Analytical Technologies; Ankeny, IA). Genomic DNA (gDNA) from matching buffy coat (paired plasma and buffy coat from the same blood tube) was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy Blood and Tissue kit. Extracted gDNA was quantified using NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific; Waltham, MA) and fragmented to a mean size of 180 base pairs using the Covaris E220 ultrasonicator (Woburn, MA). Sheared gDNA was subsequently size-selected using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter; Beverly, MA), then quantified using the Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS kit (Advanced Analytical Technologies; Ankeny, IA).
Library preparation, target enrichment, and sequencing: Library preparation, target enrichment, and sequencing Buffy coat gDNA (50ng) and plasma cfDNA (≤75ng) were used for NGS library construction with a modified Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano

protocol. The adapter includes 96 (cancer samples) or 218 (healthy controls) unique molecular identifier (UMI) sequences, of 6-mer in length, used to suppress technical assay errors. Amplified libraries were cleaned up using magnetic beads and quantified using the Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS kit.
Quantified libraries underwent hybridization-based capture with a research cancer panel targeting 508 cancer-related genes (2.13 Mb; GRAIL, Inc.; Menlo Park, CA). The panel included full exons except for the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which only included promoter regions. Additional intronic regions were included for rearrangement detection of 28 genes and copy number aberration detection of 42 genes. Up to 2ug of genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries were used for target enrichment with a modified Illumina Nextera Rapid Capture protocol. For cfDNA samples, up to 4ug of libraries (two parallel enrichment reactions) were used to maximize capture efficiencies. The two enriched libraries from the same cfDNA library were pooled and quantified using a Fragment Analyzer Standard Sensitivity NGS kit.
Three libraries per flowcell or six libraries across two flowcells were clustered (pooled and loaded across all eight lanes of each flowcell) and sequenced on a HiSeq X (Illumina; San Diego, CA) at a nominal raw target coverage of 60,000X (median collapsed target coverage [unique molecule counts] was ~4,400X). Read lengths were set to 150, 150, 8, and 8, respectively for read 1, read 2, index read 1, and index read 2. The cfDNA analysis pipeline is described in detail in Supplementary Methods.

Sample size Sample size was not pre-determined, given that this study focused on a method without any equivalent method available. Hence, sample size assumptions were not possible. All available specimens were utilized. At least 50 patients of each type of cancer were enrolled to obtain evaluable patients with both the targeted DNA assay and MSK-IMPACT analysis. Clinical data (baseline demographics, cancer history, and prior lines of therapy) were collected from medical records.
Data exclusions A consort diagram explaining the detailed sample exclusions is included as Extended Data Fig.1 and the exclusion were described in the methods.
Of the 232 cancer patients who were enrolled, 71 patients were excluded for not fulfilling the initial clinical or laboratory including criteria: - No progression or pseudoprogression: n=6 - Withdrew consent: n=2 - Wrong cohort assignment: n=3 - Blood collection error: n=16 - Blood sample not meeting inclusion criteria (outside time window, after start of new treatment, etc): n=26 - Tissue not collected or insufficient: n=4 - Tissue sequencing unavailable prior to inclusion: n=14
Of the 161 patients who met the initial inclusion criteria, 27 patients were excluded due to tumor tissue sequencing failure (n=18) or insufficient tumor tissue (i.e. specimen tumor content not meeting the MSK-IMPACT assay's minimum requirements, n=9). Additionally, 13 patients were excluded for cfDNA assay failure (n=9) or cfDNA assay QC failure (n=4).
The final analysis included 124 patients with both cfDNA and tumor tissue sequencing results.
Of the 50 non-cancer controls included in the study 3 were excluded due to cfDNA assay failure. A total of 47 controls were include in the final analysis.
Replication Technical and biological replicates were performed and are described in the text and Methods. All attempts at replication were successful. Sequencing data reproducibility for the cfDNA assay is described in the text and the results are provided in Fig.1 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 15.
Randomization This is a prospective observational study with the main aim of developing and validating a cfDNA sequencing assay. All the eligible cancer patients underwent paired tumor and cfDNA samples sequencing and the the eligible non-cancer controls underwent cfDNA sequencing. No randomization was required for this observational study. The groups (MBCs, CRPCs and NSCLCs) are groups defined on the basis of the disease type, whereas the healthy donors group was defined on the basis of absence of these diseases.
Blinding Blinding was not relevant for this prospective observational study. Mutation and copy number detection in plasma cfDNA was performed de novo, without a priori knowledge of the tumor-derived variants. After the detection of somatic genetic alterations in plasma cfDNA, the tumor-derived somatic mutations were unblinded for the comparisons performed.

Population characteristics The baseline demographic characteristics of the cohort are presented in Supplementary Table 2. The clinicopathologic features of the cohort included in this study were consistent with those of a contemporary prospectively collected cohort of consecutive cases of these malignancies.
Among evaluable patients in the metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cohort, the median age was 60 (range 30-79), 26 (67%) were hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, and 32 (82%) had invasive ductal carcinoma. In the evaluable metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort, the median age was 67 (range 33-83), 28 (68%) were female, 38 (93%) were adenocarcinomas, and 28 (68.3%) had M1b (extrathoracic metastases) disease. The median age of evaluable castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC ) patients was 67 (range 46-87), and 39 (89%) were adenocarcinoma. Overall, the majority of patients enrolled in the study received prior treatment in the (neo)adjuvant and/or metastatic settings (85% in MBC, 41% in NSCLC, 100% in CRPC): 38% of the MBC patients and 10% of the NSCLC patients had received at least three lines of therapy in the metastatic setting, and all CRPC patients had disease progression after initial castration therapy with or without androgen receptor antagonists, with 32 (78%) also receiving additional systemic therapy prior to sample collection.
Recruitment The recruitment strategy is described in the Methods section under "Patient enrollment" section.
All patients provided written informed consent for tumor, cfDNA, and WBC sequencing and review of patient medical records for detailed demographic, pathologic, and treatment information under an IRB-approved biospecimen umbrella protocol (MSKCC protocol 12-245, clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01775072). At least 50 patients of each type of cancer were enrolled to obtain evaluable patients with both the targeted DNA assay and MSK-IMPACT analysis. Clinical data (baseline demographics, cancer history, and prior lines of therapy) were collected from medical records.
Patients with MBC, NSCLC, or CRPC with disease progression as assessed by the investigator were eligible. Disease progression was based on objective radiographic and/or physical exam and/or biomarker results. Patients diagnosed with de novo or recurrent stage IV NSCLC or MBC were allowed to be included if enrolled prior to initiation of the first line of treatment for metastatic disease. No new therapies were permitted to be initiated between tissue biopsy and blood draw. Patients with progressive disease on stable doses of treatment (e.g. hormone therapy) were eligible. Blood was drawn within 6 weeks of tissue biopsy for MSK-IMPACT analysis either prior to or after tissue biopsy. Whole blood samples received outside of the stability timeframe for Streck DNA BCT (5 days) were excluded. Of 161 potentially eligible cancer patients (53 MBC, 53 NSCLC and 55 CRPC) enrolled between September 24, 2015-August 01, 2016, 124, 39 MBCs, 41 NSCLCs and 44 CRPCs were included in the concordance subset (evaluable for both tumor tissue and cfDNA analysis, Extended Data Fig. 1).
Fifty de-identified whole blood samples from self-reported healthy individuals (no diagnosis of cancer) were obtained from the San Diego Blood Bank (San Diego, CA). Limited clinical data were provided with the samples. Healthy participants were required to be at least 20 years of age, meet all eligibility for blood donation per standardized assessment and criteria, to lack a diagnosis of cancer, and to have no prior history of cancer. Participants were excluded if they had a prior history of cigarette smoking for at least one year, a current history of cigarette smoking, were pregnant, had a personal history of cancer, or had prior medical or surgical treatment of any type of cancer. Results were not returned to any patients, health care providers, or the San Diego Blood Bank.
Ethics oversight All patients provided written informed consent for tumor, cfDNA, and WBC sequencing and review of patient medical records for detailed demographic, pathologic, and treatment information under an IRB-approved biospecimen umbrella protocol (MSKCC protocol 12-245, clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01775072).
Note that full information on the approval of the study protocol must also be provided in the manuscript.

year, a current history of cigarette smoking, were pregnant, had a personal history of cancer, or had prior medical or surgical treatment of any type of cancer.
Outcomes No clinical outcome analysis was planned for this study, whose primary aims were to assess the tumor cfDNA detection rate based on observing at least one variant (single-nucleotide variants [SNVs], indels); and to assess the concordance of the MSKIMPACT variants detected in tumor biopsy samples versus cfDNA. Secondary objectives included assessing the ctDNA detection rate based on observing at least one MSK-IMPACT variant, characterizing the ctDNA detection rate as a function of the type of variant (SNV, indels) and the number of variants detected, and characterizing the proportion of patients with variants detected. Therefore, outcome data were not collected for the cohort.
