Human accelerated regions (HARs) are conserved genomic loci that have experienced rapid nucleotide substitutions following the divergence from chimpanzees1,2. HARs are enrichedincandidateregulatoryregionsnearneurodevelopmentalgenes,suggesting their roles in gene regulation3. However, their target genes and functional contributions to human brain development remain largely uncharacterized. Here we elucidate the cis-regulatory functions of HARs in human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-induced excitatory neurons. Using genomic4 and chromatin looping information, we prioritized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for functional characterization via single-cell CRISPR interference, and demonstrated their speciesspecific gene regulatory functions. Our findings reveal diverse functional outcomes of HAR-mediated cis-regulation in human neurons, including attenuated NPAS3 expression by altering the binding affinities of multiple transcription factors in HAR202 and maintaining iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation capacities through the upregulation of PUM2 by 2xHAR.319. Finally, we used prime editing to demonstrate differential enhancer activity caused by several HAR26;2xHAR.178 variants. In particular, we link one variant in HAR26;2xHAR.178 to elevated SOCS2 expression and increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons. Thus, our study sheds new light on the endogenous gene regulatory functions of HARs and their potential contribution to human brain evolution.
Humans (Homo sapiens) possess many distinct characteristics compared with our closest extant relative, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). However, despite striking phenotypic differences, the genomes of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar, sharing approximately 99% sequence identity in consensus sequences5. Early comparative analyses have revealed that differences in protein-coding sequences do not fully explain observed differences between the two species6, suggesting that these characteristics may result from differences in non-coding regions. HARs, primarily located in the non-coding genome, are genomic loci that are evolutionarily conserved across mammals; however, in humans, HARs exhibit a statistically significant excess of nucleotide substitutions, suggesting accelerated evolution1,2,7. HARs are thought to function as developmental enhancers because they are enriched at loci associated with brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia8,9. Therefore, elucidating the regulatory functions of HARs could reveal insights into human brain evolution, development and function.
Recent studies using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have demonstrated that HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues exhibit species-specific enhancer activities4,10–12. For example, 293 of the 714 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues exhibited significant enhancer activity in neural progenitor cells4. Although these studies provide much-needed functional annotation for HARs, considerable gaps remain in characterizing HARs within their native chromatin context and identifying their cognate target genes. HARs mainly scatter in poorly annotated intronic (36%) or intergenic (59%) regions3, with only eight experimentally characterized in their native chromatin context with target genes linked to distinctive human features8,10,13–18, motivating us to further characterize HARs and their target genes. We conducted comparative genomic analyses of the transcriptome, epigenome and chromatin interaction in human and chimpanzee iPS cell-induced excitatory neurons to elucidate the roles of HARs in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we prioritized and characterized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues via single-cell CRISPR

HARs exhibit enhancer functions in excitatory neurons To establish cellular models for comparative analysis of HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues, we introduced doxycycline-inducible Ngn2 at the AAVS1 locus in two chimpanzee iPS cell lines, creating isogenic, inducible i3N chimpanzee lines for generating excitatory neurons using the i3N human iPS cell differentiation protocol19 (Fig. 1a). Excitatory neurons induced from both human (WTC11 (ref. 19) and F12468 (ref. 20)) and chimpanzee (C3649 (ref. 21) and C3624 (ref. 22)) i3N iPS cell lines expressed the cortical neuron marker CUX1, the glutamatergic neuron marker VGLUT1 and the synaptic genes SYN1, SYP, SV2A and
GRIA1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that neurons from both species were homogeneous, expressing excitatory neuron markers (Extended Data Fig. 1d), and closely resembled developing human brain neurons23 (Fig. 1b). Differential gene expression analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets (Extended Data Fig.2a,b) identified 659 human-upregulated and 1,221 chimpanzee-upregulated genes (Fig. 1c). Human-upregulated genes are involved in axon development, synaptic signalling and function, whereas chimpanzee-upregulated genes are linked to organelle fission and nuclear division (Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 1). Next, we generated anti-H3K4me3 proximity ligation-assisted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (PLAC-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) datasets to characterize the epigenetic features of

3,257 previously nominated HARs10,11 and their chimpanzee orthologues (Supplementary Table 2) in neurons. We detected 222,554 and 207,087 significant H3K4me3-associated chromatin interactions at 5-kb resolution, averaging 22.2 and 17.3 interactions per promoter in human and chimpanzee neurons, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). The median interaction distance was approximately 250 kb (Extended Data Fig. 3b), with approximately 82% interactions between promoters and other distal regions in both species (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Human (70.0%) and chimpanzee (67.9%) interactions were shared, a significantly higher overlap than expected by random chance, suggesting high conservation of active promoter-anchored chromatin loops (P < 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). A significant number of open chromatin regions (approximately 54,000) were shared between species (P < 0.001; Extended Data Fig.3f,g). Finally, we observed an enrichment of overlapping accessible peaks (n = 32,000) in H3K4me3-associated chromatin-interacting regions between human (n = 49,793) and chimpanzee (n = 44,600) neurons (P < 0.001; Extended Data Fig.3h,i). Together, NGN2-induced excitatory neurons from both species are molecularly similar, enabling appropriate comparative analysis between HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues. In human neurons, 3,567 chromatin interactions overlapped with 830 HARs (Extended Data Fig. 3j), involving 1,333 HAR-interacting genes. These HAR-related chromatin interactions account for 63.5% (374 of 589) and 41.4% (521 of 1,257) of those identified by using excitatory neurons isolated from developmental and adult cortical tissues24,25, respectively, suggesting that iPS cell-induced neurons more closely resemble HAR-related chromatin interactions in primary neurons from the developing cortex (Extended Data Fig. 3k). Next, we categorized the genes into three distinct groups: group I consists of genes interacting with distal accessible HARs (385) and HAR orthologues (372); group II includes genes interacting with non-accessible HARs (324) and HAR orthologues (246); and group III comprises genes near HARs (607) and HAR orthologues (613) without significant chromatin interactions (Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Table 2). Genes interacting with HARs and their orthologues were enriched in synapse and neuron development pathways (Extended Data Fig.3l) and exhibited similarly higher expression regardless of the chromatin accessibility status of HAR and HAR orthologues than genes without any significant chromatin interactions (Fig. 1e), suggesting the regulatory role of HAR and HAR orthologues. By contrast, genome-wide gene expression analysis shows genes interacting with open chromatin regions that exhibit higher expression than genes interacting with other regions (Fig. 1e). Other conserved non-coding sequences around genes minimally affected the distinct role of HARs and their orthologues in modulating gene expression across groups in both species (Extended Data Fig. 3m). Of note, HAR-interacting genes were enriched for human-upregulated genes, whereas chimpanzee orthologues exhibited no enrichment of human-upregulated or chimpanzee-upregulated genes (Fig. 1f), highlighting the more extensive role of HARs as transcriptional enhancers in human neurons. The prevalence of HAR variants in the human population8 (Extended Data Fig. 3n) prompted us to investigate whether sequence differences between species affect transcription factor-binding affinity. Comparing transcription factor motifs enriched in the 921 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues from groups I and II revealed enrichment of motifs for the neuron developmental transcription factors, including LHX, EBF and ISL1 families in both species, consistent with their abundant binding sites of these transcription factors in HARs4 (Fig. 1g). By contrast, motifs for SCRT1, PKNOX1 and LEF1, regulators for neuron differentiation, were more enriched in human HARs (Fig. 1g), aligning with earlier predictions of their higher prevalence in HARs4. Conversely, the binding motif for PAX6, a transcription factor involved in neural progenitor cell differentiation, was more enriched in chimpanzee orthologues (Fig. 1g). Thus, species-specific transcription factor
motif enrichment may drive differential gene regulatory programs in neurons.
Characterizing HARs by CRISPRi
We then functionally characterized HARs in neurons using CRISPRi screening coupled with targeted single-cell RNA-seq (HyPR-seq)26. We prioritized 12 HARs with enhancer activities in a previous MPRA study using human neural progenitor cells4 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These HARs are linked to 54 candidate target genes (±1,500 kb centred each HAR), 10 of which are neuronal development or disease-associated genes (Supplementary Table 3). Of these, HAR96, HAR202, 2xHAR.142 and HAR122 are distributed across the introns of NPAS3 (Fig. 3a), the gene with the most accelerated regulatory domain in the human genome27. Furthermore, HAR103, 2xHAR.319 and 2xHAR.155 are located in the most accelerated gene desert region spanning approximately 1 Mb of chromosome 2 (ref. 27) (Fig. 4a), a proposed evolutionarily hotspot flanked by TDRD15 and KLHL29. Beside these 12 HARs, we selected 8 others at distal regions physically interacting with 15 neuronal development or disease-associated genes in human neurons (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table3). Of these, 2xHAR.11 exhibited human-biased enhancer activity, whereas the 2xHAR.9 orthologue exhibited chimpanzee-biased enhancer activity by MPRA in human neural progenitor cells4. To characterize the roles of HARs on gene expression, we selected 23 putative HAR-targeting genes based on: (1) associated with neuronal development or disease; (2) expressed in human and chimpanzee neurons with transcripts per million > 1; and (3) DAZL, a gene not expressed in neurons with no known brain function but interacts with HAR140 and its orthologue to investigate whether HAR140 acts as a silencer. In summary, 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues were characterized for their effect on the expression of the 23 candidate genes (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). To achieve comparable CRISPRi efficiencies in both species, we knocked in a CAG-dCas9-KRAB cassette at the CLYBL safe harbour locus in human and chimpanzee i3N iPS cell lines (Extended Data Fig.4a) with comparable CRISPRi knockdown efficiencies (Extended Data Fig.4b). We then designed 40 guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting 20 HARs (Extended Data Fig.4c as an example) and 6 non-targeting control gRNAs. Neurons differentiated from CRISPRi i3N iPS cell lines were infected with the gRNA lentiviral library at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.5). To detect gene expression changes, we designed DNA probes against the exons of the aforementioned 23 genes and unique identification barcodes for each gRNA (Extended Data Fig.4d and Supplementary Table4). These probes were hybridized in cells, amplified and sequenced for measuring gene expression and determining gRNA at single-cell resolution. Transcription levels of putative target genes between experimental and control gRNA-treated cells were compared to assessthe regulatory functions of HARs and their orthologues (Extended Data Fig.4e,f). Of the assayed HARs, 14 of 20 exhibited an effect on at least one gene in one species (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Specifically, 15 target genes were significantly downregulated following perturbation of 12 HARs in human neurons, whereas 4 target genes were significantly downregulated after perturbing 4 HAR orthologues in chimpanzee neurons, suggesting their species-specific enhancer function (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table4). Indeed, bulk CRISPRi and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses corroborated their enhancer roles in human neurons, including 2xHAR.63 for ARL8B (Extended Data Fig. 5a), 2xHAR.11 for ONECUT2 (Extended Data Fig. 5b) and HAR140 for TBC1D5 (Extended Data Fig.5c). By contrast, perturbing HAR25 and HAR96 in human neurons and HAR202 and 2xHAR.142 orthologues in chimpanzee neurons upregulated TENM3 and AKAP6, demonstrating their species-specific silencer functions (Fig. 2b,c). Our results confirm the hypothesis that HARs influence human evolution by altering gene expression. The following sections will discuss several examples of HARs exhibiting species-specific cis-regulatory functions in neurons.

HAR202 attenuates NPAS3 expression
The identification of the largest HAR cluster, consisting of 22 HARs at the NPAS3 locus, suggests accelerated evolution of the regulatory sequences therein27,28 (Fig. 3a). NPAS3 is the most accelerated gene27,28 expressed in the vertebrate brain29 and is implicated in schizophrenia30. Although NPAS3 expressions were similar in chimpanzee and human iPS cell-induced neurons (Extended Data Fig.6a), its regulatory control could be complex and species specific. To identify regulatory HARs at the NPAS3 locus, we prioritized five HARs for CRISPRi screens based on: (1) HAR144, 2xHAR.122 and their chimpanzee orthologues forming chromatin loops with the NPAS3 promoter in neurons, whereas HAR202 and 2xHAR.142 orthologues exclusively interacting with the NPAS3 promoter in chimpanzee neurons (Fig. 3a); (2) HAR202 and 2xHAR.142 exhibiting differential reporter activities compared with their chimpanzee orthologues27,28; and (3) HAR96 exhibiting the highest enhancer activity among 14 HARs tested in that region in transgenic zebrafish reporter assays27. Single-cell CRISPRi revealed that HAR144, HAR96 and 2xHAR.122, along with their orthologues, did not exhibit regulatory effects on NPAS3 in either human or chimpanzee neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6b). However, HAR144 acted as an enhancer for AKAP6, whereas both HAR96 and 2xHAR.122 functioned as enhancers for ARHGAP5 in human neurons (Fig. 2b). By contrast, the HAR202 orthologue selectively enhanced NPAS3 expression in chimpanzee neurons (Fig. 3b), confirming its enhancer activity from reporter assays in the nervous
system of transgenic zebrafish27. Although our results did not support the enhancer function of 2xHAR.142 for NPAS3 in human neurons, it had an enhancer role for BAZ1A (Fig. 2b), supporting its enhancer activity in the zebrafish nervous system27. We further validated the chimpanzee-specific enhancer function of HAR202 and 2xHAR.142 orthologues for NPAS3 by bulk CRISPRi and qPCR analyses (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6c). These findings suggest that HAR202 and 2xHAR.142 act as NPAS3 enhancers in chimpanzee neurons. To dissect the mechanism of species-specific enhancer activity of HAR202, we mapped the differential transcription factor motifs between two species (Supplementary Table 5). Binding motifs of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family transcription factors, including STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A and STAT5B, were better matched with the HAR202 orthologue (Extended Data Fig.6d). As occupancy of STAT family transcription factors on enhancers can influence their proximal histone modifications and drive chromatin accessibility31, and considering that both human and chimpanzee neurons express these transcription factors (Extended Data Fig. 6e), we hypothesized that the loss of STAT-binding sites during human evolution could explain the reduced enhancer activity of HAR202. STAT3 is the most highly expressed STAT gene in neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6e) and its binding motif aligns better with the two single-nucleotide variants in the chimpanzee HAR202 orthologue (Fig. 3d), in concordance with the greater enrichment of STAT3 in the chimpanzee orthologue than in human HAR202 (Fig. 3e).

perturbing STAT3 expression (Fig. 3g), significantly reduced NPAS3 expression in chimpanzee neurons (Fig. 3h). This confirms that STAT3 binding to HAR202 directly affects NPAS3 expression. Furthermore, BCL6 and MEIS2, critical for neurogenesis, were more enriched at HAR202, aligning with their predicted stronger binding affinity to human HAR202 than the chimpanzee orthologue (Extended Data Fig. 6d,f). Finally, the motif for PAX5, another neurogenesis-related transcription factor, better matched the HAR202 orthologue and showed less enrichment in HAR202 (Extended Data Fig.6d,f). Collectively, these results suggest a potential interplay between transcription factors in regulating NPAS3 expression across species, with variants in HAR202 conferring weaker STAT3 and PAX5 binding while promoting BCL6 and MEIS2 recruitment. To understand the role of HAR202 variants on altered enhancer function for NPAS3, we derived heterozygous human iPS cell clones (T/G) of the first variant (hg38 chromosome 14: 33,576,368) by converting one human-specific ‘G’ to the ancestral ‘T’ (Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). We then assessed the effect of this base-pair change on NPAS3 allelic expression leveraging a phased single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; C/T) in NPAS3 (ref. 33) (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e). Comparing edited and wild-type alleles in the same clone (Extended Data Fig.7e), we showed that G-to-T conversion in HAR202 significantly increases NPAS3 transcription (Fig. 3i). Together, our results demonstrate that a human-specific variant in HAR202 downregulates NPAS3 in cis via affecting transcription factor binding.
HARs as neurodevelopmental enhancers
Gene desert regions are non-coding genomic loci devoid of genes34. The most accelerated gene desert region is densely populated with 17 HARs spanning approximately 2.19 Mb (hg38 chromosome 2: 21,081,993–23,274,710)27 (Fig. 4a). Its adjacent protein-coding genes are enriched for roles in neurogenesis and psychiatric pathogenesis35–37, including (1) PUM2 and SDC1 for neural progenitor cell maintenance and proliferation, (2) RHOB, LAPTM4A and GDF7 for neuronal morphogenesis, and (3) LDAH, APOB, HS1BP3 and WDR35 linked to psychiatric pathogenesis. Recent MPRAs confirm their enhancer activity4,10–12, but their endogenous functions and target genes remain elusive. We prioritized four HARs (2xHAR.319, 2xHAR.155, HAR103 and HAR63) and tested their contribution to LAPTM4A, PUM2 and RHOB expression in neurons based on: (1) 2xHAR.319, 2xHAR.155 and HAR63 showed enhancer activity in neural progenitor cells by MPRAs4, (2) HAR103 showed enhancer activity in neuroblastoma cells by MPRAs10, and (3) 2xHAR.319 and HAR63 overlapped with accessible peaks in both human and chimpanzee neurons25 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Upon CRISPRi perturbation, 2xHAR.319 demonstrated human-specific enhancer activity for PUM2 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table4), whereas its chimpanzee orthologue exhibited enhancer activity for LAPTM4A (Extended Data Fig. 8b). These findings are correlated with the greater expression of PUM2 in human neurons

(P = 1.24 × 10−3) and the greater expression of LAPTM4A in chimpanzee neurons (P = 0.048; Fig. 4c). In addition, the HAR63 orthologue acted as an enhancer for RHOB exclusively in chimpanzee neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Consistently, the expression of RHOB was significantly decreased upon deleting the HAR63 orthologue in chimpanzee neurons (Extended Data Fig.8c,d). Thus, 2xHAR.319 and HAR63 and their orthologues exhibit species-biased enhancer activities. The function of 2xHAR.319 was also supported by matched motifs for YY1, CEBP, FOS::JUN and SP1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e and Supplementary Table 5). We deleted 2xHAR.319 and its chimpanzee orthologue in human and chimpanzee iPS cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 8c). 2xHAR.319-knockout (KO) human iPS cell clones and their differentiated cells exhibited decreased PUM2 expression (Fig. 4d), whereas LAPTM4A and RHOB were unaffected (Extended Data Fig.8d). Furthermore, these iPS cell clones exhibited downregulation of pluripotency genes (SOX2, NANOG and POU5F1), impaired self-renewal, and overexpression of ectodermal (FGF5) and mesodermal (TBXT) markers (Fig. 4e,f). Human 2xHAR.319-KO clones also failed to differentiate
into neurons (Fig. 4f). These phenotypes of 2xHAR.319-KO clones mirror the observed self-renewal deficiency in both human and mouse Pum2-mutated embryonic stem cells38,39, and the role of PUM2 in mouse neurogenesis37. Restoring PUM2 expression through CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) in human 2xHAR.319-KO cells reestablished iPS cell self-renewal, pluripotency and proper neuronal differentiation (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig.8f). In summary, 2xHAR.319 is essential for maintaining human iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation through its role as a PUM2 enhancer.
HAR26;2xHAR.178 regulates SOCS2
HAR26;2xHAR.178 harbours four variants and is in an open chromatin region that interacts with SOCS2, PLXNC1, CEP83, NDUFA12 and NR2C1 (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Except for CEP83, the other four genes are linked to neuronal function or neurological disorders40–43. Of note, Socs2 and Plxnc1 regulate cortical neurite outgrowth in mice40,44,45.

with chimpanzee neurons (P = 7.49 × 10−6), whereas no differences in expression of PLXNC1, NDUFA12 and NR2C1 were observed between the two species (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In developing brain tissues, SOCS2 and NDUFA12 have higher brain-wide expression in human compared with chimpanzee, whereas NR2C1 exhibits higher prefrontal cortex-specific expression in human46. In addition, PLXNC1 expression varies across brain tissues for both species46 (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Comparing SOCS2 expression in dorsal telencephalon trajectories between human and non-human primate organoids also showed more cortical neural progenitor cells and neurons with higher SOCS2 expression in humans, especially in cells of late-stage oganoids47 (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Single-cell and bulk CRISPRi experiments in human neurons demonstrated downregulation of all four genes upon HAR26;2xHAR.178 perturbation (Fig. 5b,c, Extended Data Fig.10a and
Supplementary Table 4), supporting the human-specific enhancer function of HAR26;2xHAR.178. To interrogate the regulatory function of four variants in HAR26; 2xHAR.178, we generated humanized chimpanzee iPS cell clones by individually knocking in each human variant in chimpanzee iPS cells (PE1–PE4; Fig. 5a), converting homozygous chimpanzee alleles to heterozygous (Extended Data Fig. 10b). We then assessed the effect of variants on gene expression leveraging phased SNPs. Variant-specific cis-regulatory effects were observed: humanizing PE1 significantly increased the allelic expression ratio of SOCS2 (P = 0.003) and NDUFA12 (P = 0.003), whereas PE2 significantly increased the allelic expression ratio of PLXNC1 (P = 0.04; Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig.10c) between edited and wild-type chimpanzee allele. In addition, PE2 and PE4 confer opposite effects on NDUFA12 (Extended Data Fig. 10c) and SOCS2

(Fig. 5d) expression, respectively, supporting the compensatory evolution theory of HARs4. To substantiate this, we generated PE1–PE4 and PE1–PE2 double prime-edited clones (Extended Data Fig. 10d) and assessed their effect on SOCS2 and NDUFA12 expression, respectively. As expected, PE1–PE4 double-edited clones (n = 3) showed an attenuated increase in SOCS2 expression compared with PE1 single-edited clones (n = 3; Extended Data Fig. 10e), whereas NDUFA12 expression was similarly affected in both PE1–PE2 double-edited (n = 3) and PE1 single-edited clones (n = 3), possibly because PE1 exerts a more profound effect on NDUFA12 expression, masking the negative regulation caused by PE2 (Extended Data Fig. 10e). We explored transcription factor-binding motifs in HAR26;2xHAR.178 (Supplementary Table5) and found PE1 and PE2 better matched NR2F1 and TFAP2A motifs, respectively (Fig. 5e). Both transcription factors are expressed in human and chimpanzee neurons (Extended Data Fig.10f), and their co-occupancy links to permissive enhancer chromatin states48. We hypothesized that the HAR26;2xHAR.178 locus gained a higher affinity for NR2F1 and TFAP2A binding during human evolution. This can be confirmed by the increased binding of NR2F1 and TFAP2A in humanized chimpanzee neurons, comparable with their enrichment in human neurons (Fig. 5f). Human iPS cell-induced neurons exhibited increased neurite outgrowth compared with chimpanzee neurons by Neurite Tracer and Sholl analysis49 (Fig. 5g,h). This difference was attributed to the elevated expression of SOCS2, as SOCS2 knockdown reduced neuritogenesis in human neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10g–i). Humanized (PE1) chimpanzee neurons exhibit significantly increased neurite branching compared with wild-type chimpanzee neurons (Fig. 5h and Extended Data Fig. 10j). As expected, neurons of PE1–PE4 double-edited clones demonstrated attenuated neurite growth compared with neurons of PE1 single-edited clones (Extended Data Fig. 10k,l), consistent with the SOCS2 levels in these clones. These results confirm the role of HAR26;2xHAR.178 as an evolutionary enhancer regulating neural genes, for example, SOCS2, an important regulator of neuritogenesis (Fig. 5i).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying HAR-mediated cis-regulation in neurons. By comparing regulatory functions between HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues, we identified 12 HAR enhancers regulating 15 target genes in human neurons and 4 chimpanzee HAR orthologues regulating 4 target genes in chimpanzee neurons. We also functionally characterized the phenotypic consequences of HARs and their differential regulation of target genes in excitatory neurons. In particular, we have demonstrated that the cis-regulatory function of HAR26;2xHAR.178 results in enhanced SOCS2 expression and neuritogenesis, an essential process during human brain development. MPRA-based high-throughput methods enable the regulatory annotation of HARs outside their native chromatin context, which is insufficient for identifying HAR target genes4,10–12. Our high-resolution chromatin interaction analysis represents a major advance in the comparative characterization of HARs and the endogenous targets of their orthologues in human and chimpanzee neurons, respectively. Using single-cell CRISPRi screens, we quantified the differential regulatory capabilities of previously uncharacterized HARs between species. Finally, by introducing species-specific variants in iPS cells, we have provided novel models to study HAR endogenous regulatory activity at base-pair resolution. The observation that multiple variants within the same HAR can confer opposing effects on enhancer activity has been proposed as a form of compensatory evolution in which HARs maintain ancestral enhancer activity via transcription factor binding sitemodifications4. In line with this theory, our prime-editing results revealed opposite cis-regulatory effects of individual variants within HAR26;2xHAR.178
on SOCS2 and NDUFA12 expression. Moreover, we have demonstrated that HAR202 and 2xHAR.142, two closely located HARs (2.88 kb part) in an NPAS3 intron, upregulated the expression of BAZ1A and PSMA6 in human neurons; however, their chimpanzee orthologues instead upregulated NPAS3 expression while downregulating the nearby AKAP6 expression. Although these HARs do not precisely fulfil the criteria for compensatory evolution, from an evolutionary point of view, they imply an alternative mechanism in which the human-specific variants may act to maintain ancestral enhancer function by inducing the regulation of different target genes. Together, our findings support the compensatory evolution theory of HARs. Further characterization of the opposing, synergistic and redundant effects of HAR variants on gene expression is still warranted. Finally, our prime-editing experiments demonstrate that the regulatory effects of HARs on endogenous target genes are associated with enhanced neuritogenesis. Expanding research to other brain cell types, neurodevelopmental stages and invivo models, along with exploring other rapidly evolved loci, such as human ancestor quickly evolved regions50, holds the potential to deepen our understanding of the roles of HARs in mediating the enigmatic process of human brain evolution.

Ethics statement
Human and chimpanzee iPS cell lines from healthy donors previously collected and stored at the UCSF were used in the study. The study is exempt from continuing UCSF institutional review board review and approval and is also exempt from federal regulations (exemption number E4) based on the following: “45CFR 46.101.(b)(4): research involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records, pathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if these sources are publicly available or if the information is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects”.
Cell culture
A well-characterized human iPS cell line with a wild-type genetic background (WTC11)19 with the Ngn2 transgene and a second human iPS cell line F12468 (ref. 20) with the Ngn2 transgene were used for human cell culture. For the chimpanzee cell culture, the iPS cell lines (C3649 (ref. 21) and C3624 (ref. 22)) gifted from Yoav Gilad’s laboratory were used. iPS cell lines were maintained on Matrigel-coated (354277, Corning) plates with fresh mTeSR Plus medium (100-0276, StemCell Technologies) every 2 days. Both human and chimpanzee iPS cells were passaged using Accutase (07922, StemCell Technologies) and mTeSR Plus medium containing 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y-27632 (72302, StemCell Technologies). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (11995065, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; FBS-500, CPS Serum). HEK 293T cells were passaged with trypsin-EDTA (25200072, Gibco). All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell cultures were routinely assessed to ensure they were free of mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (LT07-218, Lonza).
Knock-in Ngn2 and dCas9-KRAB in human and chimpanzee iPS cell lines
Both human iPS cells WTC11 and F12468 are already genetically modified with the knock-in of doxycycline-inducible mouse neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) in the AAVS1 safe harbour locus19,20. For introducing inducible Ngn2 into the two chimpanzee iPS cell lines (C3649 (ref. 21) and C3624 (ref. 22)), the same inducible Ngn2 cassette19 was introduced at the chimpanzee AAVS1 safe harbour locus by a TALEN nuclease pair19. Cells were sorted into single cells in a 96-well plate to obtain single clones as previously described51. Genomic DNA from expanded clones was isolated with QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (QE09050, Lucigen) and PCR genotyping based on Wang et al.19. To generate human (WTC11 and F12468) and chimpanzee (C3649) excitatory neurons stably expressing dCas9-KRAB driven by the CAG promoter (modified from Addgene, 89567), the donor vector with TALEN pairs was electroporated into iPS cells targeting the CLYBL safe harbour locus (98.3% similarity for each recombination arm between human and chimpanzee). After 4 days, neomycin was used to select positive iPS cells. Then, mCherry-positive cells were FACS sorted to enable the isolation of individual cells. Isolated cells were cultured for approximately 1.5 weeks, and the Neo-eF1a-mCherry cassette was deleted via the Cre–loxP system and PCR genotyping with genomic DNA. The chimpanzee iPS cell line C3624K expressing dCas9-KRAB (ZNF10/KOX1) was generated according to Fair et al.52. iPS cells (1 × 106) were plated (100,000 cells per cm2) and transfected using 10 μl Lipofectamine Stem (STEM00001, Invitrogen) with 3 μg pC13N-dCas9-BFP-KRAB (127968, Addgene), 0.375 μg pZT-C13-L1 (62196, Addgene) and 0.375 μg pZT-C13-R1 (62197, Addgene). BFP-positive iPS cells were isolated by FACS after 1 week. Site-specific integration at the CLYBL locus was verified by PCR. Finally, all four iPS cell lines with inducible Ngn2 and dCas9-KRAB showed normal karyotyping results (Cell Line Genetics).
Generation of human and chimpanzee iPS cell-induced neurons Positive clones after knock-in experiments, as mentioned above, were then differentiated into neurons with appropriate pre-differentiation and subsequent maturation steps as previously described19. To ensure an accurate comparison of the results, we performed differentiation with the same number of cells at day 0 (cells starting pre-differentiation) and day 3 (a transition step from pre-differentiation to postmitotic neurons) for both human and chimpanzee iPS cells, and also for comparison between wild-type and 2xHAR.319-deleted clones. In brief, iPS cells were dissociated and seeded in Matrigel-coated plates and cultured in N2 medium containing BDNF (450-02, PeproTech), NT-3 (450-03, PeproTech), mouse laminin (23017-015, Life Technology), doxycycline (D9891, Sigma-Aldrich) and Rock inhibitor (72302, StemCell Technologies). This medium was changed for the following 2 days without Rock inhibitor. After 3 days in N2 medium, pre-differentiated cells were dissociated and seeded in poly-l-ornithine (P3655, Sigma-Aldrich) coated plates with maturation medium containing the aforementioned differentiation factors except Rock inhibitor. Half of the medium was changed weekly for 2 weeks to generate mature neurons.
Single-cell RNA-seq
The iPS cell-induced excitatory neurons were dissociated using Accutase for 20 min. The reaction was neutralized with mTeSR Plus medium, and the cells were then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. The nonviable cells were removed using the Dead Cell Removal Kit (130-090-101, Miltenyi Biotec). The pelleted cells were resuspended in cell suspension buffer and processed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Fluent BioSciences). In brief, approximately 20,000 cells were transferred into pre-templated instant partitions (PIPs) for mRNA capture. The integrity and quality of the PIPs/cell emulsions were visually inspected to ensure they met the manufacturer’s standards. mRNA isolation, synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification of cDNA, library preparation, library pooling and sequencing were all performed with the PIPseq T2 3′ Single Cell Sequencing Kit. The sequencing of the prepared cDNA libraries was conducted on the NovaSeq 6000 system, utilizing paired-end 150-bp reads. Sequencing data were then aligned, and a gene expression matrix was generated for each cell using the software PIPseeker (Fluent BioSciences) with the hg38 or panTro5 reference genome. The generated matrices were further analysed using the Seurat package (v4.1.1) for detailed downstream analysis. All data processing metrics are reported in Supplementary Table 6.
Comparing transcriptomes between human, chimpanzee iPS cell-induced excitatory neurons and cells from the developing human cortex
We compared single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) results from iPS cellinduced neuron results with a published human cortex single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset23. The Seurat R package (v4.1.1)53 with default settings was applied to the analysis. We used the Seurat Canonical Correlation Analysis to integrate data from different scRNA-seq data. Then, the top 10 principal components were selected for non-linear dimensionality reduction to generate a UMAP plot.
Immunocytochemistry
Two-week neurons grown on coverslips were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by three washes with 1× PBS. The cells were permeabilized in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 20 min at room temperature followed by three washes with 1× PBS. Then, cells were incubated for 30 min in TBST containing 1% normal serum (blocking buffer) at room temperature followed by three washes with 1× PBS. Coverslips were carefully transferred onto parafilm with the fixed side facing up, and 50 μl of primary antibody in blocking buffer was added (anti-CUX1, 1:1,000 dilution, ab54583, Abcam; anti-βIII-tubulin antibodies, 1:2,000 dilution,


802001, BioLegend; anti-VGLUT, 1:200 dilution, MAB5502, Millipore; anti-SOX2: 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling, 14962T; and anti-NANOG, 1:1,000 dilution, 1E6C4, Cell Signaling) onto the coverslip. Coverslips were then incubated for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with 1× PBS, 50 μl of the secondary antibody in blocking buffer (Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, A10042, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500 dilution; Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-mouse IgG, A10037, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500 dilution; Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, A21206, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500 dilution; and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG, A21202, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500 dilution) was added onto the coverslip followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed three times with 1× PBS, and all remaining liquid was carefully wicked away with Kimwipe. Finally, coverslips were pressed onto a drop of DAPI on a glass slip with their fixed side facing down, while ensuring no bubbles were created in the process. Once positioned, coverslips were incubated for approximately 1–24 h in the dark. Excess mounting media were removed, and when coverslips were dry, they were examined and imaged via fluorescent microscopy.
HAR annotation used in this study
HARs and their paired chimpanzee orthologues in our study are from a union of 3,171 HARs annotated in Girskis et al.10 and 241 HARs from Keough et al.11 that were used for supporting HAR enhancer hijacking hypothesis. This led to a total of 3,257 unique HARs (Supplementary Table 2). We noticed a discrepancy in HAR202 annotation between Kamm etal.27 and Girskis etal.10. Five human-specific variants in HAR202 (hg18 chr14: 33,115,156-33,115,595) were mentioned by Kamm et al.27, whereas only two variants were annotated (hg38 chromosome 14: 33,576,362–33,576,566) in Girskis et al.10. The first three of five variants studied in Kamm etal. were not conserved among all non-human primates and thus did not meet the criteria of HAR fastest evolution definition2. We, therefore, utilized the updated HAR202 annotation from Girskis et al.10.
PLAC-seq
PLAC-seq was performed according to the protocol from the ArimaHiC+ Kit (P/N A101020, Arima Genomics). In brief, 4–5 × 106 human or chimpanzee neurons crosslinked with 2% PFA and containing 15 μg of genomic DNA were used per PLAC-seq reaction. Then, crosslinked chromatin was digested using a restriction enzyme cocktail followed by a 5′ overhang fill-in step with a biotinylated nucleotide. Next, the proximally ligated chromatin was then fragmented by a sonicator (S220, Covaris) using the following settings: set point temperature of 4–6 °C, peak incident power of 105 W, duty factor of 5%, cyclers per burst of 200 and treatment time of 300 s, immunoprecipitated with anti-H3K4me3 antibody (1:400 dilution, 04-745, Millipore) conjugated Dynabeads (M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG, 11203D, Invitrogen), and purified with SPRI beads to yield fragmented proximally ligated DNA. Finally, TruSeq sequencing adapters for NovaSeq (150-bp paired-end reads) were then added to the products. Raw paired-end fastq PLAC-seq libraries were trimmed to 100 bp using fastp (v0.20.1) before being processed through the Arima MAPS (v1.1.0) pipeline with default parameters, 2-Mb binning range and X chromosome processing. Human and chimpanzee samples were processed using their respective genomes (hg38 or panTro5 assembly). Anchor peaks were generated by calling peaks using the default MACS2 settings “--broad --nolambda --broad-cutoff 0.3” from 20 million short BAM reads extracted and merged from each replicate of WTC11 and C3649. These peaks were cross-lifted to each genome and combined to generate a consensus peak set for each genome. After checking quality control values for deep-sequencing data, the feather outputs of each replicate were merged to call final interactions. All data processing metrics are reported in Supplementary Table6. To compare significant
interactions between chimpanzees and humans, interactions from each species were lifted over using UCSC liftover (v1.28.0) to the other species using the same 5,000-bp bin size to identify orthologous interactions. Successful lifting over required retaining at least 30% of the sequence. Any interaction that could not be lifted to another species was identified as unsuccessful liftover. We further performed a GenomicRanges intersect54 to identify the conserved interactions between the two species in hg38 or panTro5.
ATAC-seq
ATAC-seq was performed as described by Song etal.33 using the Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (FC-121-1030, Illumina). In brief, live cells were washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS containing protease inhibitor and resuspended in ice-cold nucleus extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA630 and 1× protease inhibitor) for 5 min. Next, 50,000 cells were counted per reaction and transferred into 50 μl 1x buffer TD with 2.5 μl TDE1 enzyme for 30 min at 37 °C for transposition. The fully transposed DNA was purified with Qiagen MinElute spin columns (28006, Qiagen), PCR amplified and size-selected with AMPure XP beads for fragments between 300 bp and 1,000 bp. Libraries were subjected to paired-end 150-bp sequencing on the Novaseq 6000. Raw paired-end fastq ATAC-seq libraries were trimmed to 100 bp using fastp (v0.20.1). Trimmed libraries were passed through the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline (v1.10.0) using default settings for replicates of each cell line, as well as for the pooled dataset of each species. The irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) optimal peak sets were then selected for downstream analysis. Both human and chimpanzee samples were processed using their respective genomes (hg38 or panTro5 assembly), and hg38 blacklist regions were lifted to panTro5. All data processing metrics are reported in Supplementary Table 6. To compare the significant ATAC-seq peaks between chimpanzees and humans, peaks from each species were lifted over to the other species using the same bin size as the original species to identify orthologous peaks. Successful lifting over required retaining at least 30% of the sequence. Any peaks that could not be lifted to another species were identified as unsuccessful liftover. We further performed GenomicRanges intersect54 to identify the conserved peaks between the two species in hg38 or panTro5.
Bulk RNA-seq
Total RNA was isolated from fresh cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (74134, Qiagen) and RNA with an integrity number of more than 8 was used for library preparation as described33. In brief, approximately 1 μg of RNA from samples was processed for sequencing libraries using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (20020594, Illumina). Libraries were subjected to paired-end 150-bp sequencing on the Novaseq 6000 platform. Raw paired-end fastq RNA-seq libraries were trimmed to 100 bp using fastp (v0.20.1) and mapped to both hg38 and panTro5 assemblies, respectively, using STAR 2.7.9a with the standard ENCODE settings. Transcript quantification was performed using RSEM 1.3.1 with gene annotations from GENCODE 44 for hg38 and Ensemble Pan_tro_3.0.110 for panTro5. Genes with average counts of less than 10 were filtered out. Differential expression analysis between humans and chimpanzees was performed using DESeq2 (v1.42.1) with raw counts mapped to hg38 or panTro5 assembly separately to avoid mapping bias due to different assemblies. Principal component analysis was generated using the default parameters of DESeq2. Differential genes for each assemble were identified as having an adjusted P value of less than 0.1. To determine consistently differentially expressed genes across different genome mapping assemblies, human-specific upregulated genes and chimpanzee-specific upregulated genes were identified as significant in both genome assemblies. All data processing metrics are reported in Supplementary Table 6.

Differential expression analysis for HAR putative target genes
To determine the regulatory activity of HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for putative target gene expression in neurons, we mapped both human and chimpanzee RNA-seq reads to the hg38 human genome assembly. We next selected and sorted genes for human and chimpanzee genomes matching the following three epigenomic criteria groups. Group I contained genes interacting with accessible distal regions or HARs or their chimpanzee orthologues determined from PLAC-seq and ATAC-seq datasets, group II contained genes interacting with distal regions or HARs or HAR orthologues not overlapping ATAC-seq peaks, and group III contained genes neighbouring but not interacting with any accessible distal regions or HARs or HAR orthologues. In addition, to have a comparable number of genes in each group for each species, we selected and included all genes with homologues sequence for comparison. To check the enrichment of species-upregulated genes related to the HAR target genes, odds ratios were calculated to represent the effect enrichment of differential expression genes related to the HARs within groups I and II. P values were calculated based on Fisher’s exact test. To test whether other conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) confound the expression of HAR-interacting genes, we obtained 197,695 CNSs from the 100-way vertebrate conserved sequence dataset55. These CNSs do not overlap with mRNAs and are shared between humans and chimpanzees. We further generated an ‘other’ CNS (OCNS) dataset by excluding CNSs overlapping with HARs, resulting in 193,141 OCNSs. For each gene, we counted the number of OCNSs located within ±100 kb of the transcription start site and performed linear regression analyses of gene expression by gene group (groups I, II and III, representing different relationships to HARs and their orthologues), with and without adjusting for OCNS count as a covariate.
gRNA design and cloning into HyPR-seq vectors
gRNAs were designed based on the human h38 and chimpanzee panTro5 assemblies, respectively. The coordinate of each HAR in the human genome was lifted over to the chimpanzee genome to identify its orthologous coordinates. Two gRNAs targeting within 200 bp upstream or downstream of each HAR were designed with GuideSCAN56 for each species with the following criteria that have been widely used for different CRISPR or CRISPRi screening57–59: (1) the set of all 20-mer sequences followed by an NGG (A, T, C or G followed by two G nucleotides) protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the HAR region (hg38 assembly) and their orthologue region (panTro5 assembly) were identified; (2) filtered out gRNAs that have multiple occurrences in the genome with no mismatches or one mismatch; (3) removed gRNAs with extreme G and C content (the total of C and G nucleotides of more than 80% or less than 20%); (4) eliminating polynucleotides of more than 3 bp to promote efficiency; and (5) filtered out gRNAs with cutting efficiency less than 0.25 or specificity less than 0.20. We tried to use the same gRNAs for HARs and HAR orthologues based on GuideSCAN design. However, if the summit of open chromatin peaks for the HARs and their chimpanzee orthologous region differs, different gRNAs were design to target the centre of the peaks for human and chimpanzee. We also designed non-targeting gRNAs that do not target any human or chimpanzee genomic sequences as negative controls. The sequence ‘CACC’ was added to the 5′ sense end and the sequence ‘AAAC’ to the 5′ antisense end of all gRNAs for the vector assembly. The full-length sequences were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. All gRNA oligos are reported in Supplementary Table 4. To clone human and chimpanzee gRNAs, single-stranded gRNA oligos were first denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and then passively cooled to room temperature for annealing. The linearization of HyPR-seq vector backbones #1-28 (ref. 26) was performed using BsmBI (R0739S, NEB) followed by gel purification. Next, 100 ng of human or chimpanzee gRNA oligos was incubated with 700 ng of linearized vectors, T4 DNA
ligase (M0202S, NEB) and 1× T4 ligation buffer (B0202S, NEB) in a 10-μl reaction at room temperature for 30 min. After ligation, the products were electroplated into Stellar Electrocompetent Cells (636765, Takara) and cultured at 37 °C overnight. Finally, plasmids were extracted using the Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I (D6942-02, Omega Bio-tek) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Lentivirus packaging
To grow a monolayer of HEK293T cells for lentivirus packaging, cells were plated in T25 flasks 18–24 h before transfection to achieve 70–80% confluency at the time of packaging. Around 30–60 min before transfection, complete culture medium with antibiotics and serum was added to each flask. Then, DNA was diluted (pre-mix gRNA Lentivirus library, PsPAX (12260, Addgene) and pMD2.G (12259, Addgene) in a ratio of 5:3:1) into serum-free DMEM with high glucose (10569-010, Gibco) and gently pipetted up and down to mix thoroughly. For each flask, PolyJet reagent (SL100688, SignaGen) was diluted into the same volume of serum-free DMEM with high glucose that was used to dilute the DNA, and gently pipetted up and down 3–4 times to mix thoroughly. Diluted PolyJet reagent was directly added to the above DNA solution all at once and pipetted up and down 3–4 times to mix well. The mixture was then incubated for 15 min at room temperature to allow PolyJet–plasmid transfection complexes to form. For the final phase of packaging, the transfection mixture was added dropwise onto the medium and each T25 was gently swirled to homogenize the mixture. After 12–18 h, the medium containing the PolyJet–plasmid transfection complexes was aspirated from each flask and replaced with fresh medium containing serum and antibiotics. Supernatant was collected and changed with fresh media every 20–24 h for 3 consecutive days, and stored at 4 °C. Then, all collected viral medium was spun down for 10 min to remove dead cells, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm Millex HV Syringe Filter Unit (SLHVM33RS, MilliporeSigma). Finally, the filtered medium was centrifuged at 3,000g and 4 °C for 60 min in an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter (10 or 100 kDa; C7715, MilliporeSigma) to concentrate the virus solution to a final volume of approximately 300 μl. The concentrated lentivirus solution was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.
Single-cell CRISPRi and HyPR-seq
The pooled gRNA lentiviral libraries titration was determined and then a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.5) was used to infect neurons. Neurons were then treated with puromycin (500 ng ml−1; P8833, SigmaAldrich) for 5 days after infection. Neurons (4–5 × 106) were harvested for targeted scRNA-seq library construction. Just before neuron dissociation, 25 μl of DNase I (DN25, Sigma-Aldrich; 400 U ml −1, 400 Kunitz unit per mg protein) and 5 μl of 1 M MgCl2 was added to each 1 ml of activated papain, and the tube was inverted twice to thoroughly mix reagents. Medium was removed from human and chimpanzee 2-week neurons in 12-well plates and cells were carefully washed once with 1× HBSS (200 μl per well). Then, 200 μl of activated papain was added per well and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After dissociation, cells were quenched with 600 μl of DMEM/F12 medium (11330-0322, Gibco) containing 10% FBS (9628642, Sigma-Aldrich). All neurons were then collected from each well in a 50-ml tube and triturated 10–15 times with a 1-ml pipette to make them into single cells. Three volumes of DMEM/ F12 medium with 10% FBS was then added, and the cells were spun down at 400g for 7 min at room temperature. Supernatant was then carefully removed with a 1-ml pipette and the dissociated single-neuron pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS for the further experiments such as HyPR-seq. To assess for changes to putative target gene expression following perturbation of our HARs of interest, 5 pairs of complementary DNA probes were designed for the exons or 3′ untranslated regions of 23 putative target genes (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Table 4). Three pairs of probes, each with unique binding sites, were


also designed for each gRNA detection barcode26. We adapted the HyPR-seq protocol from Marshall et al.26, which can be briefly separated into three steps: cell preparation, emulsion droplet generation and library preparation. First, to prepare cells, papain-dissociated single neurons were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution followed by permeabilization in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Five pairs of the same single-stranded DNA probes per gene were designed using the HyPR-seq probe-design pipeline (https://github.com/EngreitzLab/ hypr-seq). The probes were pooled to a concentration of 20 nM per probe and incubated with the neurons at 37 °C overnight. The neurons were then harvested for hybridization with B1H1 hairpin oligos (Molecular Instruments) followed by ligation with readout oligos. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h during both hybridizations. After ligation, cells were filtered through a 20-μm pluriStrainer (43-0020-01, pluriSelect). The resulting single-cell suspension was checked and counted before proceeding to emulsion droplet generation. For step two, we made 20-μl droplet PCRs with 1× EvaGreen Supermix (1864033, Bio-Rad), 500 nM indexing primer, 20,000 barcoded beads (Chemgenes) and 2,000 cells. Around 50,000 cells per replicate were loaded in the emulsion generation step, and approximately 15,000 cells were packaged into droplets according to the Poisson distribution. Emulsions were generated using the QX200 Digital Droplet Generator (1864002, Bio-Rad) based on the manufacturer’s default instructions. Following the generation of droplets, emulsion PCRs were activated via UV treatment (6.5 J cm−2 at 365 nm) for 5 min, at a distance of 5 cm from the UV bulb. Then, droplet PCR amplification was performed with the following program: 94 °C for 30 s; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 64 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min final extension. All PCR cycling steps were carried out using a 50% ramp rate (2 °C min−1). To extract the library cDNAs, all PCR products were combined, and emulsions were disrupted and purified with the introduction of 0.5 volumes of 97% 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluoro-1-octanol (370533, Sigma-Aldrich). Then, following vortexing for 5 s and centrifugation at 1,000g for 1 min, the top aqueous layer was collected and library cDNAs were purified with 1.8× SPRI beads. For step three, purified libraries were deep sequenced using custom primers. We sequenced approximately 5,000 reads per cell covering 23 target genes and 28 gRNA detection barcode sequences. Using the HyPR-seq pipeline, we generated a singleton unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix, and approximately 10,000 singletons were analysed for each run. Raw UMI counts were normalized by the total read counts from each cell and scaled by 1,000. By obtaining positive gRNA counts that numbered sixfold greater than the second most enriched gRNA, we assigned the correct gRNA to each cell. A single gRNA was successfully assigned to about 40% of the cells. To merge count matrices from batches, UMI counts for each target gene were normalized by the average UMI counts among all negative control gRNA-infected cells within the same batch. Finally, CRISPRi effects resulting from enhancer HAR-perturbed cells were analysed compared with pooled negative control cells by applying the corrected P values, which were calculated based on the two-sided, two-sample Student’s t-test and adjusted by Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction. An FDR < 0.05 serves as the cut-off for gene expression changes.
Validation of HAR enhancers using CRISPRi
To validate the enhancer activity of HARs identified from HyPR-seq, we cloned individual gRNAs targeting within 200 bp upstream or downstream of each putative HAR enhancer into CROPseq-opti vectors (106280, Addgene) containing a blasticidin resistance sequence. Two-week excitatory neurons differentiated from human and chimpanzee inducible Ngn2 iPS cells and stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were infected with lentiviruses carrying three replicates per gRNA target. The gRNA-infected cells were propagated in 12.5 μg ml−1 blasticidin-containing (10 mg ml−1; A1113903, Gibco) medium and mRNAs were isolated 1 week post-transfection.
To quantify mRNA level knockdown of selected genes by specific gRNAs in CRISPRi neurons, human and chimpanzee 2-week neurons containing positive and negative gRNAs were lysed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy Plus Kit (74134, Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For RT–qPCR, total RNAs were reverse transcribed using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (1708840, Bio-Rad). Of RNA, 1 μg was used per 20 μl reverse transcription reaction. The qPCRs were run on the LightCycler 96 System (Roche) and the following program was used for qPCR: 95 °C for 3 min, then 39 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by melting curve determination. The iQ SYBR Green Supermix (1708882, Bio-Rad) was used for qPCRs. Fold changes were normalized to GAPDH. The primers used for qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 7.
Validation of HAR enhancers using CRISPR deletion
To validate the enhancer activity of candidate HARs in the most accelerated gene desert region, densely populated with 17 HARs spanning approximately 2.19 Mb (chromosome 2: 21,158,370–23,351,086) on chromosome 2 (ref. 27) for both human and chimpanzee, we precisely deleted HARs of interest without perturbation of nearby HARs via CRISPR-mediated deletion. Paired gRNAs targeting putative HAR enhancers were designed using the CHOPCHOP web tool60. Cas9 protein was acquired from QB3-Berkeley. All gRNAs were synthesized with the GeneArt Precision gRNA Synthesis Kit (A29377, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate HAR-knockout cell lines, CRISPR–Cas9 and in vitrotranscribed gRNAs were nucleofected into iPS cells using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (V4XP-3024, Lonza). Approximately 500,000 iPS cells were nucleofected with Cas9–gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (consisting of 10 μg Cas9, 8 μg gRNA 1 and 8 μg gRNA 2) per reaction. The Lonza 4D-nucleofector program ‘A-023’ was used for all nucleofections. The nucleofected cells were then cultured in Matrigel-coated six-well plates containing mTeSR Plus medium (1000276, StemCell Technologies). After 48 h, the cells were dissociated with Accutase and subject to single-cell sorting via FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). One week later, single-cell-derived clones were genotyped by PCR and edited clones were differentiated into excitatory neurons for putative target gene (PUM2, RHOB and LAPTM4A) expression measurement. For each experiment, we used two deletion clones and two control clones. Total RNA from human and chimpanzee 2-week excitatory neurons was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Kit (74134, Qiagen) followed by cDNA synthesis with the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (1708840, Bio-Rad). qPCR for targeted genes was performed as described above. qPCR primers and gRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 7.
STAT3 inhibitor treatment of neurons
To inhibit STAT3 DNA-binding activity in neurons, the culture medium was supplemented with the selective STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201 (Selleck Chemicals) in DMSO, at varying concentrations. The effects of S3I-201 on neuron viability were assessed at a series of concentrations (10 μM, 15 μM, 20 μM, 25 μM, 30 μM, 35 μM, 40 μM, 45 μM and 50 μM). Following treatment for 48 h, more than 90% of neurons were alive when treated at a concentration of 35 μM than control; however, beyond 45 μM, almost 100% cell death was observed. We, therefore, used the S3I-201 concentration of 35 μM for subsequent experiments. After differentiation for 2 weeks, mature neurons were treated with 35 μM S3I-201 or 5% DMSO for 48 h. Neurons were harvested for assessing gene expression and transcription factor binding.
ChIP–qPCR
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as previously described by Weintraub etal.61 with minor modifications. First, 4–5 × 106 human or chimpanzee neurons were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde. Cells were then rinsed twice with 1× PBS and harvested. The resulting


Article
crosslinked cells were resuspended in 60 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mM DTT and 1× protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The lysate was then combined with 60 μl dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.2 mM EDTA, 1.1% Triton X-100, 167 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1× protease inhibitors). Of diluted lysate, 120 μl was transferred into sonication tubes and the chromatin was sheared into 200–300-bp fragments by sonication (S220, Covaris). The sonicated lysate was centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected. Dilution buffer was then combined with the lysate to a total volume of 600 μl. Of this solution, 60 μl was reserved for input to test immunoprecipitation efficiency. The remaining lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody-bound magnetic beads (anti-STAT3, MA1-13042, Invitrogen; anti-BCL6, PA5-27390, Invitrogen; anti-TFAP2A, PA5-17359, Invitrogen; anti-NR2F1, PP-H8132-00, R&D Systems; anti-MEIS2, sc-515470, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or anti-PAX5, ab109443, Abcam). After immunoprecipitation, the bead-lysate reactions were washed twice with each of the following buffers: low-salt and high-salt washing buffer, LiCl washing buffer and 1× TE. DNA was eluted off the beads via two 15 min incubations at 65 °C with 1,000 rpm vortexing in 200 μl of the elution buffer (0.1 mM NaHCO3 and 1% SDS). Reverse crosslinking was performed overnight at 65 °C and DNA was purified for ChIP–qPCR experiments using SYBR Green mix (1708882, Bio-Rad) the following day. The results depicted in the corresponding figures were normalized to the input and a negative control region accordingly. qPCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table 7.
Increasing PUM2 expression by CRISPRa
To elevate the PUM2 expression in human 2xHAR.319 knockout iPS cells, CRISPR-mediated activationwas performed62. Three gRNAs were used based on the design from Horlbeck et al.63. We cloned individual gRNAs into lentiSAMv2 backbones (75112, Addgene) containing a blasticidin resistance gene. The WTC11 iPS cells were transduced with a lentiMPHv2 (89308, Addgene) vector in six-well plates followed by selection with hygromycin (150 μg ml−1; 10687010, Gibco) for 7 days. MS2-p65-HSF1-expressing iPS cells were individually transduced in biologic triplicate with equal volumes of each lentiviral gRNA expressing dCas9-VP64-MS2 in six-well plates followed by selection with blasticidin (4 μg ml−1; A1113903, Gibco) for 4 days; mRNAs were then isolated post-transfection for the determination of PUM2 expression. Two-week excitatory neurons differentiated from human CRISPRa iPS cells were used for the immunostaining experiments.
Prime editing
We first designed pegRNAs and nicking gRNAs (ngRNA) for each of the four variants within the chimpanzee HAR26;2xHAR.178 orthologous sequence, and for each of the two variants within HAR202 using pegFinder64 with the default parameters. Two spacer sequences corresponding to these gRNAs were integrated into a common template guide oligo: cacc [ngRNA spacer] gtttaGAGACGttcgaaagCGTCTCacacc [PegRNA spacer] gttttagagc and synthesized by IDT. We then annealed each type of oligo individually, including guide oligos, pegRNA extension oligos and tevopreQ1 3′ end structure oligos. For the first cloning step, all annealed oligos were ligated into a BsmBI-digested custom lentiCRISPRhU6 acceptor vector with a mCherry marker. For the second cloning step, to assemble the full pegRNA expression cassette, the tracRNA(E/F)human U6 promoter fragment was cloned into the BsmBI-digested vector to produce the final pegRNA–ngRNA co-expressing plasmids for each variant. Human or chimpanzee iPS cells (2 × 106) were transfected per reaction with 5 μg of pegRNA–ngRNA co-expressing plasmid and 5 μg of PE2-expressing plasmid containing an eGFP maker (132775, Addgene) using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (V4XP-3024, Lonza). Two days post-transfection, single cells expressing both eGFP and mCherry were sorted in Matrigel-coated 96-well plates with mTeSR Plus media, Rock inhibitor and penicillin–streptomycin using FACSAria II
(BD Biosciences) instrument using a 100-μm nozzle. The transfected cells were grown for 2 weeks, and the resulting single-cell-derived clones were isolated and assessed for desired editing by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Positive cells were then differentiated into neurons for further experiments. For the double prime editing, we used the same strategy as shown above to transfect the HAR26;2xHAR.178 PE2-expressing or PE4-expressing plasmids into the PE1-edited chimpanzee iPS cells and assessed for the desired PE1/PE2 and PE1/PE4 editing by PCR and Sanger sequencing. All oligos used for prime editing are listed in Supplementary Table 7.
Motif analysis
To nominate the specific transcription factor motifs enrichment for individual HARs of interest, the full set of vertebrate motifs from the JASPAR database65 was used for motif detection first. Individual HAR sequences, including HAR202, 2xHAR.319 and HAR26;2xHAR.178 and their chimpanzee orthologous sequences, were used as input for motif enrichment. The matrix profiles of 1,205 vertebrate transcription factor motifs from the JASPAR database65 were used to perform the comparative motif enrichment analysis. Motifs with a JASPAR score of more than 0.8 were used as output and compared with the HARs of each species or chimpanzee orthologues, respectively, for shared and unique enriched motifs. To determine how well the identified transcription factor motifs by JASPAR database matched with the 19-bp sequences centred on each human-specific or chimpanzee-specific HAR variant, the motifbreakR package (v2.12.0)66 was applied. In brief, individual HARs analysed above or their chimpanzee orthologous sequences containing each variant were passed to motifbreakR leveraging dbSNP155.GRch38 or dbSNP155.panTro5, respectively. Transcription factor motifs matching the human-specific or chimpanzee-specific variants were returned for further visualization and enrichment analysis (for example, human versus chimpanzee comparison via ChIP assay). For motif enrichment analysis of all accessible and interacting HARs in human and chimpanzee neurons, HAR loci (n = 921) exhibiting accessibility and interaction in both species were used as input for analysis with HOMER (4.11.1)67 using default settings.
Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis
Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using clusterProfiler (v3.18.1)68. 659 human neuron-specific upregulated genes, and 1,221 chimpanzee neuron-specific upregulated genes (P < 0.01 likelihood ratio test, fold change > 2; Supplementary Table 1) were used as input and compared with a genome-wide background gene list (n = 20,745 for human and n = 19,240 for chimpanzee). Enriched Gene Ontology terms from the ‘GO Biological Process’ ontology were reported based on the counts of enriched genes and the log10(adjusted P value). Gene Ontology terms for each category with q values below the cut-off of 0.05 are reported in the Supplementary Table 1.
Allelic expression imbalance analysis
We used the human WTC11 phasing data33 along with the chimpanzee C3649 phasing data (provided by G. Wray) to quantify the allelic expression imbalance between the reference and edited allele in heterozygous excitatory neurons. Heterozygous HAR variant clones were sequenced via TOPO cloning, and each variant allele was linked to its corresponding heterozygous allele from a phased SNP in the target gene. Allele-specific transcript levels were then quantified and compared with derive allele-specific expression ratios for each HAR variant allele. To minimize the noise introduced by conventional differentiation techniques, 2–3 independent clones were used per HAR-edited line. In brief, the PCR amplicons overlapping SNPs towards the 3′ end for selected genes from human or chimpanzee neurons were first end-repaired, A-tailed and ligated with Illumina Truseq adapters. Paired reads were aligned to their target sequences in the human hg38 and chimpanzee panTro5


reference genomes, respectively, using bowtie (v1.2.1.1)69. Then, read counts were obtained for aligned reads exactly matching either allele. The allelic imbalance was determined by calculating the allelic ratios for SNPs associated with genes of interest. All oligos for allelic RT–PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 7.
Neurite Tracer and Sholl analysis
To measure neuronal morphology, approximately 100,000 neurons were grown on coverslips for 2 weeks, then infected with lentiviruses expressing eGFP with approximately 1% of the neurons and were successfully infected with positive GFP expression. Cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA and then immunostained with an anti-GFP antibody (ab1218, Abcam), anti-βIII-tubulin antibodies (802001, BioLegend) and corresponding secondary antibodies. Neurons were examined and imaged via fluorescent microscopy and preserved for Neurite Tracer and Sholl analysis. Neurites were quantitatively retrieved using the ImageJ Neuroanatomy Plugin with Simple Neurite Tracer analysis70. The centre of the soma for each sparsely labelled neuron was assigned to the neurite growing paths for the Simple Neurite Tracer analysis. Next, neurite complexity was further quantified by performing Sholl analysis49 using the centre of each soma as the focal point. We used the default parameters in the plugin dialogue box within ImageJ, including the radius step size of 20 and the ending radius of the length of the longest neurite. The number of intersections at each radius for each measured neuron was exported for analysis. For each cell line, 15 eGFP-labelled neurons were analysed and the standard error of the mean was calculated to determine the variability of each observation.
